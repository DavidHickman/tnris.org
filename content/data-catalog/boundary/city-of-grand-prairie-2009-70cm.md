This LiDAR project is intended to provide high accuracy, classified multiple return LiDAR, for approximately 139 square miles, of the City of Grand Prairie, Texas. The LiDAR data was acquired and processed by Terrapoint USA to support hydrologic modeling and other engineering tasks. The product is a high density mass point dataset with an average point spacing of 0.7m. The data is tiled without a buffer, stored in LAS 1.0 format. The elevation data was verified internally prior to delivery to ensure it met fundamental accuracy requirements when compared kinematic to Terrapoint GPS checkpoints. The LiDAR dataset for the City of Grand Prairie was tested 0.22ft vertical accuracy based on consolidated RMSE.
