"March 16-17, 2015",Spatial Analyst,8:30 - 5:00,TeachMeGIS Instructor,$775,Open,,"Raster datasets (images, grids, surfaces) are used in many geoscience applications. Satellite images, isopachs, bathymetry, surface tops and bottoms, and gravity/magnetics datasets can be viewed in ArcMap along with the rest of your GIS data. The Spatial Analyst extension of ArcGIS contains tools for creating, managing, and analyzing these raster datasets. By learning how to effectively display them in the map, and understanding the details of the data behind the images, you can tap into these rich data sources.",,
"March 18-20, 2015",ModelBuilder - Custom Tools and Automated Workflows,8:30 - 5:00,TeachMeGIS Instructor,"$1,010",Open,,"With ModelBuilder, you can automate workflows in ArcGIS without writing code! By graphically connecting tools together, and connecting those tools to input datasets, you can create your own custom workflows (your own tools) in ArcToolbox. From repetitive data loading (i.e. loading new competitor data once a month) to complex analysis (site investigation studies, play assessments), geoscientists and geoscience technicians are using Model Builder to help them in their daily tasks.
This course teaches you the basics of building models and handling data in ModelBuilder, then shows you how to take your models to the next level by including variables and looping constructs. For example, you can build a model that automatically renames all of the feature classes in a particular geodatabase or one that loops through all of the unique values in an attribute table. ",,

"April 16-17, 2015",Fundamentals of ArcGIS,8:30 - 5:00,TeachMeGIS Instructor,$775,Open,,"GIS gives you an easy way to get access to the tremendous amounts of data available. At first glance, ArcGIS lets you see this  data on a map. But underneath, the software has powerful tools for analyzing the data. With ArcGIS, you can quickly print a bubble map showing crime rates, evaluate parcel values across a city, plan a location to open a new branch of your business, or explore a site for potential environmental issues. This course helps you understand the types of data that ArcGIS supports, and how to manipulate the data. For example, you will learn how to connect to an Excel spreadsheet that has GPS location data in it. This class is the first step in learning to incorporate this valuable application into your daily workflows. ",,

Students learn the fine details of editing in ArcMap, including how to use the proper combination of feature templates, construction methods, and workflows. The course introduces both map topology and geodatabase topology, and teaches students to effectively use topology constraints to keep data clean throughout the editing process. Students will also learn how to georeference an image and trace features off the image using ArcScan.

"May 13-14, 2015",Queries & Tables,8:30 - 5:00,TeachMeGIS Instsructor,$775,Open,,"Tables are an integral part of GIS. Most GIS users know how to view attribute tables, but are not aware of the advanced queries and calculations that can be done with tables. This class is designed to teach you how to make tables work harder for you. Learn how to make complex queries that can be re-used and shared. See how to manipulate tables to integrate information without making changes to the tables. Learn tips and tricks to populating an attribute with a calculation or advanced function, like incrementing values. Discover the possibilities hidden beneath the simple columns and rows that make up a table.",,
"May 15, 2015",Linear Referencing,8:30 - 5:00,TeachMeGIS Instructor,$410,Open,,"This 1-day course teaches students the foundational concepts of linear referencing and their application in real world situations. Various linearly referenced datasets, such as street networks, pipeline systems and seismic lines, are introduced. Students are instructed how to create and edit routes and their measurements in an ArcMap edit session, and how to use the Linear Referencing Toolbar to effectively display and label those routes.

"June 1-3, 2015",Intermediate GIS Concepts,,TeachMeGIS Instructor,,Open,,"ArcMap can do so much more than simple map display and navigation. It has many tools for answering questions with the data you already have. Take your ArcGIS skills to a new level by learning to manage your data. Create new files and modify existing ones. Combine existing data into new datasets to show well and lease information in one table. Discover the immense functionality available in ArcToolbox. Take your map layouts to the next level with enhanced labels, new techniques for layouts. Make use of some lesser known features of ArcMap, like seeing animations of schools being place over a century of time, link parcels to other documents like deeds, and attach photographs to road hazard locations.",,

"August 20-21, 2015",Making Better Maps,8:30 - 5:00,TeachMeGIS Instructor,,Open,,"Overview -- There is a big difference between making a map and making a good map. It is not just a matter of putting map elements on a piece of paper. There are definitely some tricks to getting all the right information on the map without cluttering up the whole thing. A map is all about the story it is trying to convey. By choosing symbols and labels wisely, a map can tell a complete story. This course covers tips and tricks on making those choices, as well as teaching students about visual hierarchy – how to draw attention to certain details and away from others.
