title: 2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project
template: page.html
abstract: 
    The 2014-2015 Statewide Texas Orthoimagery Program fulfills the charge led by TNRIS to develop aerial imagery statewide as a base map resource for state, regional, and local government entities. This program regularly acquires consistent and updated aerial imagery in order to develop geospatial products throughout Texas. These data are used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base of reference for other map information.

##Contributors

Four state agencies contributed funds toward the BASE 0.5-meter statewide orthoimagery collection. They are the Texas Department of Transportation, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the Railroad Commission of Texas Surface Mining and Reclamation Division, and the Texas General Land Office.

Five additional government agencies contributed funds toward select 1-foot or 6-inch BUY-UP areas. They are the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, University Lands, the San Antonio River Authority, and the City of Georgetown.

##Acquisition Season

![Leaf-on Imagery sample](/images/statewide-orthoimagery/season_leafon.jpg)
![Leaf-off Imagery sample](/images/statewide-orthoimagery/season_leafoff.jpg)
All orthoimagery products are acquired during the leaf-off (fall/winter) season in TX. Leaf-off imagery allows manmade structures under deciduous tree cover to be mapped or monitored more easily than using leaf-on imagery. Vegetation mapping can also be beneficial with leaf-off imagery because evergreen vs. deciduous species are more readily identified.

##Pixel Resolution	
The BASE statewide orthoimagery will be acquired and processed at 0.5-meter pixel resolution. Select BUY-UP areas will be acquired and processed at either 1-foot or 6-inch pixel resolution. The following are example features identifiable in each resolution.

##Spectral Resolution

##High Priority Imagery and Data Sets Contract

The High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) Contract was used to select the orthoimagery provider, Surdex Corp., from a pool of prequalified geospatial data providers. The contract is held by the Council on Competitive Government and administered by TWDB/TNRIS.
