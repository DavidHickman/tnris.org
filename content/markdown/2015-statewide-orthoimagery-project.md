## Contributors

<p class="lead"><strong>Four state agencies</strong> contributed funds toward the BASE 0.5-meter statewide orthoimagery collection.</p>

They are the [Texas Department of Transportation](http://www.txdot.gov), the [Texas Commission on Environmental Quality](http://www.tceq.state.tx.us), the [Railroad Commission of Texas Surface Mining and Reclamation Division](http://www.rrc.state.tx.us), and the Texas [General Land Office](http://www.glo.texas.gov).

<p class="lead"><strong>Five additional government agencies</strong> contributed funds toward select 1-foot or 6-inch BUY-UP areas.</p>

They are the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency](https://www.nga.mil/Pages/default.aspx), the [Texas Parks and Wildlife Department](https://tpwd.texas.gov/), [University Lands](http://www.utlands.utsystem.edu/), the [San Antonio River Authority](https://www.sara-tx.org/), and the [City of Georgetown](https://georgetown.org/).

## Acquisition Season

<p class="lead">All orthoimagery products are acquired during t<strong>he leaf-off (fall/winter) season in TX</strong>.</p>

Leaf-off imagery allows manmade structures under deciduous tree cover to be mapped or monitored more easily than using leaf-on imagery. Vegetation mapping can also be beneficial with leaf-off imagery because evergreen vs. deciduous species are more readily identified.

## Pixel Resolution	
<p class="lead">The BASE statewide orthoimagery will be acquired and processed at <strong>0.5-meter pixel resolution</strong>.</p>

Select BUY-UP areas will be acquired and processed at either 1-foot or 6-inch pixel resolution. The following are example features identifiable in each resolution.

## Spectral Resolution
<p class="lead">All orthoimagery products will be available as <strong>4-band images</strong>.</p>

These may may be displayed as natural color (Red, Green, Blue) or color infrared (Near Infrared, Red, Green) composites, as seen in the examples below.

## High Priority Imagery and Data Sets Contract

The [High Priority Imagery and Data Sets](high-priority-imagery-data-sets) (HPIDS) Contract was used to select the orthoimagery provider, [Surdex Corp](http://www.surdex.com)., from a pool of prequalified geospatial data providers. 

The contract is held by the [Council on Competitive Government](http://www.ccg.state.tx.us) and administered by TWDB/TNRIS.
