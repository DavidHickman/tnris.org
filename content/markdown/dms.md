The Data and Mapping Solutions (DMS) section of Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) applies design, communication, and technology skills to provide data solutions and cartographic products, both conventionally and digitally, for internal geospatial development, support of emergency management efforts, economic development activities, and to the geographic information systems (GIS) communities of Texas, the Texas/Mexico border and beyond. 

The DMS section performs complex data management practices, data processing, data creation, map production, cartographic standard development, and performs highly advanced GIS and geospatial quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) services and technical assistance work in the development of GIS data and tools. 

The mission of DMS is to develop innovative solutions to represent geographic information on maps, web sites, online viewers, web mapping services, and within geographic software programs. DMS works in conjunction with TNRIS/TWDB and requests and is requested to help with other sections on a daily bases.

##Activities
- #### Basemap development and maintenance

    Develops and maintains GIS layers, symbolization, and annotation for basemap production. Continuously updates basemap production processes, geospatial data, and database organization.

- #### Create, develop and maintain TNRIS Web Mapping Services

    Maintains existing GIS web-based capabilities and services. Creates new web mapping services to better serve our customers by incorporating all relevant TNRIS data into useable digital formats. Performs quality control and assurance (QA/QC) measures and processes to meet cartographic standards, maintain software performance, and meet general guidelines.

- #### Perform QA/QC on incoming data

    Provides complex QA/QC practices on all received data to ensure quality, thoroughness, and importance before any data is added to any database, made available for digital download, or made available for internal use.

- #### Provide cartographic design, data collection, data assembly, data consultation, and data support to all Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) and external customers
    Designs and maintains cartographic layer representation and digital content with emphasis on online viewing for data downloading, web site viewing, and web-based mapping applications. 

    Collects, assembles, and distributes data to web developers for incorporation into web-based applications. Provides cartographic consultation to web developers on how to best represent digital data to meet standards. DMS provides quality control and assurance (QA/QC), data flow testing, and performance testing for all TNRIS online web-mapping applications.

- #### Participate in Data Sharing workgroup in support of Stateâ€™s Geographic Information Officer (GIO)
    Participates in various ways in support of the GIO by attending internal coordination meetings, data sharing workgroups, GIS conferences and workshops, and the annual TNRIS Texas GIS Forum.

- #### Coordinate and fulfill internal and external map and GIS data requests in order provide TWDB staff and the public with the most up to date, relevant, and detailed information
    Provides cartographic and GIS support to meet the needs of the requestor by issuing pre-made maps, digital graphics, or by creating custom maps and GIS data..

- #### Develops GIS and cartographic design standards, processes, and mapping templates for implementation into all avenues of cartographic production and database management 
    Creates and maintain design standards, GIS layer symbolization, and mapping templates to maintain consistency and organization for all GIS and mapping products, hard copy publications, and digital graphics.

- #### Provides data tracking, data recording, and archival services for all incoming geospatial raster and vector data 
    Develops, organizes, and updates databases with information regarding all incoming data that enters TNRIS. Provides reports to staff on all database updates, changes, and data specifications.
