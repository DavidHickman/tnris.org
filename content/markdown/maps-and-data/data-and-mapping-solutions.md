The Data and Mapping Solutions section of TNRIS applies design, communication,
and technology to provide data solutions and cartographic products to the
geographic information systems (GIS) communities of Texas, the Texas/Mexico
border and beyond. Our technologists have decades of experience working with
analog and digital mapping in support of emergency management and economic
development.

## Activities

- #### Basemap development and maintenance

    Develop and maintain GIS layers, symbolization, and annotation for basemap
    production. Continuously update basemap production processes, geospatial
    data, and database organization.

- #### Create, develop and maintain TNRIS Web Mapping Services

    Maintain existing GIS web-based capabilities and services. Create new web
    mapping services to better serve our customers by incorporating all relevant
    TNRIS data into useable digital formats. Perform quality control and
    assurance (QA/QC) measures and processes to meet cartographic standards,
    maintain software performance, and meet general guidelines.

- #### Perform QA/QC on incoming data

    Perform thorough Quality Assurance and Quality Control on all received data
    before it is made available for digital download or included in databases
    for internal use.

- #### Provide cartographic design, data collection, data assembly, data consultation, and data support to Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) and external customers

    Design and maintain cartographic layer representation and digital content
    with emphasis on online viewing for data downloading, web site viewing, and
    web-based mapping applications.

    Collect, assemble, and distribute data for web-based applications. Work
    with web developers to meet defined standards for representing and serving digital
    data. DMS also provides quality control and assurance (QA/QC), data flow
    testing, and performance testing for all TNRIS online web-mapping
    applications.

- #### Participate in Data Sharing workgroup in support of Stateâ€™s Geographic Information Officer (GIO)

    Participate in various ways in support of the GIO by attending internal
    coordination meetings, data sharing workgroups, GIS conferences and
    workshops, and the annual TNRIS Texas GIS Forum.

- #### Coordinate and fulfill internal and external map and GIS data requests in order provide TWDB staff and the public with the most up to date, relevant, and detailed information

    Provide cartographic and GIS support to meet the needs of the requestor by
    issuing pre-made maps, digital graphics, or by creating custom maps and GIS
    data.

- #### Develops GIS and cartographic design standards, processes, and mapping templates for implementation into all avenues of cartographic production and database management

    Create and maintain design standards, GIS layer symbolization, and mapping
    templates to maintain consistency and organization for all GIS and mapping
    products, hard copy publications, and digital graphics.

- #### Provides data tracking, data recording, and archival services for all incoming geospatial raster and vector data

    Develop, organize, and update databases with information regarding all
    incoming data that enters TNRIS. Provides report to staff on all database
    updates, changes, and data specifications.
