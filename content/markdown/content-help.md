## Editing Content

The TNRIS site is built using a **Markdown Generator**. This means most basic text content is inside simple text files and written using **markdown**, a simplified version of HTML.

If you are a content editor, then our web team has already assisted you with pulling a copy of the TNRIS site code onto your local computer into a folder in your main personal files (my computer, etc.) called:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
	<h4>www/localdev</h4>
</div>

Within this are various folders and files to edit content.

The only folders with files or content you will be editing are the ```content``` folder and the ```static``` folder.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
	<h4>www/localdev/content</h4><br>
	<h4>www/localdev/static</h4>
	<p>
		<strong>Do not</strong> edit any files outside of these folders
	</p>
</div>

## Adding Images

In order to add an image to your markdown you use the following code

```
![alt text](images/FILENAME)
```

You can also also ask the site manager to add images into your content file, but please upload your desired image into the appropriate folder within the ```static``` folder.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
	<h4>www/localdev/static/images</h4>
</div>
