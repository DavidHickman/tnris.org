The Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) was established in 1997 by Senate Bill 1 to develop consistent statewide digital data layers.  Its primary goal is to acquire and improve digital geographic data for statewide mapping applications.  StratMap also maintains comprehensive data standard specifications to ensure consistent, high quality data products across the State.

The original StratMap layers funded by the Texas Legislature and other partners (state agencies, federal agencies, local entities) are:

- Orthoimagery
- Hydrography
- Political boundaries
- Transportation
- Soils
- Elevation
