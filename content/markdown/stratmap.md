The Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) was established in 1997 by Senate Bill 1 to develop consistent statewide digital data layers.  Its primary goal is to acquire and improve digital geographic data for statewide mapping applications.  StratMap also maintains comprehensive data standard specifications to ensure consistent, high quality data products across the State.

The original StratMap layers funded by the Texas Legislature and other partners (state agencies, federal agencies, local entities) are **Orthoimagery**, **Elevation**, **Hydrography**, **Political Boundaries**, **Transportation**, **Soils**.

The StratMap program has changed in scope and while it still operates to bring...it has

## Orthoimagery
<p class="lead">StratMap has facilitated and spearheaded many imagery projects throughout the course of it's operations.</p>

Orthoimagery is digital aerial photography that has been geometrically corrected (orthorectified) to remove distortion caused by camera optics, aircraft tilt, and differences in ground elevation. This data layer at 1-meter and 0.5-meter pixel resolution is used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base of reference for other map information. 

Leveraging State funds from multiple agencies, the StratMap Program coordinated statewide orthoimagery acquisitions starting in the mid-1990s. Since then, the state has been refreshed with new orthoimagery in 2004, 2008/09, and 2010, all in conjunction with the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) administered by the USDA-Farm Service Agency-Aerial Photography Field Office. NAIP continues to refresh Texas statewide with new orthoimagery every two years (2012, 2014) during the leaf-on growing season (April – October acquisitions). Pooling State funds again in 2014, StratMap coordinated a new statewide leaf-off acquisition to occur during the 2014/15 winter season.

Since 2009, using the [High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS)](high-priority-imagery-and-data-sets) contract, StratMap has coordinated numerous higher resolution (6-inch/1-foot) orthoimagery regional acquisition projects within Texas.

## Elevation

{{m.catalog_data_card('elevation-contours/stratmap-hypso')}}

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a technology that utilizes lasers to measure the distance from an airborne sensor (such as an airplane) to points on the ground. This creates an accurate 3-dimensional representation of the earth’s surface. LiDAR goes beyond traditional bare earth digital elevation models (DEMs) by producing point cloud information that can be classified into existing features such as vegetation and man-made structures.

TNRIS acquires LiDAR data through partnerships with other federal and state agencies as well as through our high priority imagery and data sets(HPIDS) contract to make this data available to the public. LiDAR coverage varies across the state. LiDAR coverage and project details (date, nps, vendor, etc.) can be found on the LiDAR Status Map . All details about each dataset in our collection can be found in the QAQC for each project (see below).

## Political boundaries (Legacy)

<p class="lead">Boundary lines are not meant to divide but to give context and meaning to the land.</p>

The StratMap Boundaries were originally created as a common political dataset delineating county, city, parks, and various “landmark” boundaries such as airports, universities, wildlife refuges, and military bases. They are derived from various sources such as Texas Department of Transportation, Texas Parks and Wildlife, and local jurisdictions. StratMap Boundaries are primarily used for cartographic display but are also useful in preliminary right-of-way determination, highway planning and maintenance, real estate, public services, jurisdiction maintenance, and other administrative assessments.

The StratMap political boundary dataset is the foundation layer of the StratMap Program and is updated annually at a minimum. Updating the dataset requires constant contact with our data sharing partners, frequent data research, and a consistent update schedule. Our data sharing partners range from local entities, county offices, and COGs (e.g. NCTCOG), to statewide data providers (e.g. TxDOT) and federal entities (e.g. US Census Bureau). The data update and release process is generally the same for park, city, and cultural boundaries, with county boundaries as the exception. County boundary lines are authoritative and require extensive legal consideration before changes are made. As such, county boundary updates in Texas occur very infrequently.
