The Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) was established in 1997 by Senate Bill 1 to develop consistent statewide digital data layers.  Its primary goal is to acquire and improve digital geographic data for statewide mapping applications.  StratMap also maintains comprehensive data standard specifications to ensure consistent, high quality data products across the State.

The original StratMap layers funded by the Texas Legislature and other partners (state agencies, federal agencies, local entities) are:

<p>
The StratMap political boundary dataset contains political jurisdictions, state boundaries, county boundaries, city boundaries, federal parks, state parks, and landmark boundaries (airports, universities, wildlife refuges, and military bases).</p>

<p>StratMap Boundaries are useful in right-of-way determination, highway planning and maintenance, real estate, public services, jurisdiction maintenance, and numerous administrative assignments. Each of the boundary datasets are derived from various sources such as the Texas Department of Transportation, Texas Parks and Wildlife, and local jurisdictions to create the most comprehensive datasets available.

<p>
The StratMap transportation layer is an updated, digital version of the transportation features found on the 7.5 minute, 1:24,000 scale USGS quadrangle maps. Where available, digital ortho-photography and GPS data are used to improve positional accuracy. Transportation features encompass all public roads in Texas, including city streets, state and federal highways, interstates, and selected private roads.</p>
<p>The transportation layer is designed to be a universal transportation layer that can be integrated into a GIS application or project. The StratMap statewide transportation dataset is a publicly available digital data layer which serves as a cartographic product </p>

<p>
Hypsography (elevation contours) Digital Line Graph (DLG-3) data are currently derived by digitizing map features as line graph elements from the cartographic source materials.  The scale of the source materials is 1:24,000.
