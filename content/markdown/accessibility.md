TNRIS is committed to making its Web site accessible according to the standards set forth by the [Worldwide Web Consortium's](http://www.w3.org) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). To improve the accessibility of our Web site, we test any major redesign with screen readers and other tools. The results of these reviews are incorporated into the Web site. We currently use various tools for site validation and it is our goal to achieve the highest level of accessibility attainable.

If you use assistive technology and the format of any material on our Web site interferes with your ability to access information, please e-mail the TWDB Web accessibility coordinator through [webmaster@twdb.state.tx.us](mailto:webmaster@twdb.state.tx.us)

When you contact us, please be sure to tell us each of these points:
- The nature of your accessibility problem
- The format in which you prefer to receive the material
- The Web address of the requested material
- How we can contact you

With this information, we will be able to respond in the most helpful way possible.
