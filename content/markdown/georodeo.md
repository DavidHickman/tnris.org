These days, the common thread among many web maps is very likely a JavaScript library called [D3.js](http://d3js.org). D3 is quickly becoming the de facto choice when it comes to data visualization in the browser. It provides incredible flexibility by embracing web standards, resulting in few limitations other than a developer's imagination. In this talk, Andy will take the intimidation out of this little powerhouse of a library, and show you the essentials you need to begin making your own incredible maps with D3.
