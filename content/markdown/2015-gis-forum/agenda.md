        <h4>Assessing The Utility Of Pixel-based And Object-based Classification Methods For Surveying Wetland Vegetation With An Unmanned Aerial System</h4>
         <p>Wetlands maintain critical ecological processes that enhance water quality, support diverse habitat, and provide several other environmental services. Constructed and restored wetlands attempt to mitigate the loss of natural wetlands, improve water quality, meet water supply demands, and support wildlife habitat. </p>
        <p>The 5,762 ha Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area located near Palestine, Texas, features a constructed wetland that covers nearly 900 ha and supports a variety of amphibians, invertebrates, migratory birds, and waterfowl. The wetland system incorporates five sediment basins and 20 inundated cells. As 95% effluent water from the Trinity River flows cell-to-cell, clay substrate and vegetation absorb phosphorus, nitrogen, and other nutrients, which improves water quality before it is returned to the Trinity River. The importance of annual areal vegetation coverage estimates are indicated by the cell-to-cell spatial diversity of vegetation, which fluctuate by abundance, age, and species. Mapping vegetation is essential to evaluate the biodiversity, overall health, and success of the restored wetland system. </p>
       <p>In Fall 2014, Meadows Center for Water and the Environment used an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect high-resolution imagery (18 cm) of the wetland cells. Ground truth data, including species composition denoted by point, transect, and polygon units, were collected using Trimble Geo XH units to ensure accurate geo-location. Imagery was processed with Agisoft’s Photoscan and ArcGIS software. Using ground truth data, estimated vegetation cover was classified using two approaches: a supervised pixel-based method completed with ERDAS Imagine and an object-based classification using eCognition Developer. </p>
       <p>Initial results show that pixel-based classification produces patchy, non-contiguous results known as the ‘salt-and-pepper effect’, whereas object-based classification does not.  Overall, the products derived from object-based image classification offers increased potential to reduce the ‘salt-and-pepper effect’, improve classification accuracy, and enhance visual interpretability. Ultimately, the classification products will contribute to establishment of vegetation response to different restoration practices, geographic patterns of annual growth rates for specific vegetation species, and habitat suitability.</p>

        <h4>Monitoring Change in West TX using NAIP Imagery from the Texas Natural Resources Information System</h4>
        <p>In the world of oil and gas exploration the land surface is subjected to change with the addition of new roads and drilling rigs that dot the landscape.  The rapid change can negatively affect the environment and ground water resources as well as have an impact on land and mineral ownership issues.  Updating a GIS database to reflect the latest changes in an area of resource exploration can be challenging using manual methods. </p> 

        <p>Remote sensing using multiple dates of NAIP imagery from the Texas Natural Resources Information System allows for accurate change detection to help monitor the new additions of roads and drilling sites.  This presentation describes a workflow used to prepare image data, detect new change, and output update features as a vector data set.  By monitoring change in this way, GIS databases can be kept up to date in areas where there is rapid change.</p>

        <h4>UAV Solutions Using Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry Applications</h4>
        <p>The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) market is blowing up in the North America, especially with more lenient US FAA regulations already undergoing comment, which means positive changes are imminent. The need exists for a UAV solution to process the image data using Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry applications with possible service to a web client.  Hexagon Geospatial has the technology to put together the complete solution from hardware to the internet from one single vendor.</p> 
        <p>In this session we will discuss some of the problems to overcome with these UAV solutions and show many different ways of producing value added data from these UAV’s. Currently in the US you need a pilot license and a certificate of Authorization or 333 to fly in accordance to the FAA.  With basic rules in the US being flying under 400 feet, 5 miles from any airspace and line of sight of the UAV must be less than 1 mile. Attend this session and become more equipped to handle the UAV solution explosion.</p>

        <h4>Innovative Public Health Care GIS Applications</h4>
        <p>The potential to apply Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies across the public health care field is enormous and just beginning to reap significant benefits.  Health care focused GIS applications require the integration and analysis of diverse, updated, and (at times) proprietary data from such fields as: health, finance, education, sociology, environment, geography, and informatics.</p> 

       <p>There is a genuine need to define and map the accessibility to community health resources or assets (i.e., health facilities, education, recreation, transportation, and shopping [i.e., food, medicine, etc.]) and conduct associated spatial gap analyses and ranking. In support of these gap analyses, GIS has also recently been effectively applied to map and expose such community health related disparities as food, medicine, and play “deserts”. </p>

       <p>Sam Houston State University’s (SHSU) Office of Research and Sponsored Program’s (ORSP) new GIS Center and College of Health Sciences are actively working on projects with university (SHSU and Universidad de Iberoamérica [UNIBE]), county (e.g., Montgomery County United Way), regional, and country (Costa Rica) level not-for-profit health care focused organizations. The purpose is to provide the capacity and tools to more systematically and quantitatively generate the necessary metrics and maps to measure, visualize, communicate, and enhance the impact of their various programs in the context of community health outcomes.</p>
       <p>Furthermore, the relationship between existing assets and of social determinants of health are also being emphasized. Through a more quantitative and systematic understanding of existing community resources and needs, as well as funding effectiveness that is directly associated with measurable impacts on community outcomes, these not-for-profits will be able to more strategically create improved partnerships between existing community based organizations with the objective of creating healthy communities.</p>
       <p>This presentation describes the specific tasks, deliverables, and outcomes for each health care not-for-profit’s GIS project that SHSU is working presently on.</p>

        <h4>GIS at the Wimberley Flash Flood Disaster</h4>
        <p>GIS has become an essential element of all types of emergency response at all levels of government (and the private sector): Federal, State and Local. Through a Common Operating Picture (COP), a GIS-based status display is shown through a web map viewer, where a variety of relevant information can be tracked, displayed and queried in real time, from any location.     
          <p>In addition, information that is collected in the field by Search &amp; Rescue teams can be instantly integrated into the COP, allowing for those in the Incident Command Post to evaluate the information and dispatch resources such as K9 or helicopter crews to a specific location. </p>

          <p>The evolution of GIS for the Wimberley response from paper maps, to simple web map viewer (COP), to field Collector app and eventually to an Operations Dashboard showing all relevant response information and metrics will be discussed.     (TNRIS provided valuable support to the response by creating a river system layer that was used to create SAR search zones.)</p>

        <p>In 2013, realizing the need to address water quality concerns in the river in an integrated fashion, the governments of the US and Mexico created a binational forum for cooperation and information exchange under the auspices of the International Boundary and Water Commission.  The effort, known as the Lower Rio Grande/Río Bravo Water Quality Initiative (LRGWQI), is a pilot project designed to establish binational mechanisms to protect water quality in the river.</p>
        <p>Among the technical goals of the LRGWQI is the modeling of pollutant loadings and instream water quality in the river, including simulation of scenarios associated with changing population, infrastructure and management practices.</p>
        <p>In order to facilitate binational decision making associated with this cooperative technical effort, UT’s Bureau of Economic Geology, in collaboration with the UT’s LBJ School of Public Affairs, developed a geospatial decision support system in Python. The GIS functionalities are enabled using the Python-based Application Programming Interface of QGIS, an open source GIS software. SQLite, a serverless, self-contained database system is used for managing user-specified and system configuration data.</p> 
        <p>We present the principal capabilities and features of the LRGWQI DSS, discuss some of the challenges we encountered using the QGIS software to develop the application and present some of the modifications and additions we are currently incorporating into the system.</p>

        <h4>GIS Lessons: Learning to Query and Code with the CartoDB Academy</h4>
        <p>Maps provide us with some of the most intuitive ways to represent data visually, principally because they provide a way to rectify our physical locality with some digital and data-dense topography; they help us build narrative with relevant geolocation and let us tell trends with data on a geospatial-sensitive canvas. Learning how to make compelling maps with your own data is a a non-trivial endeavor, involving a concatenation of expertise and technical aptitudes with specialty tools that might be obscure to new mappers, and limits the community as a result.</p> 
        <p>At CartoDB (http://cartodb.com/), we have a series of open source projects to augment the GIS learning experience, with Academy (http://academy.cartodb.com/), our "code academy" for GIS, or our Trainings repository (http://cartodb.github.io/training/), a place to share lessons and workshops and submit events to a collaborative calendar.    We'll talk about the future of education for digital geographers, and how partnering with curriculum producers has fostered a supportive community of stellar mappers across domains. Join us to learn about how we do it, and how you can help!</p>

        <h4>Open Source Software Education in Texas</h4>
        <p>There is a growing movement in the Texas GIS community to use open source application software, such as QGIS, to implement spatial solutions for governments and businesses.  Until recently, there were only a few rare options available for learning FOSS4G in an educational setting. As the result of a recent Department of Labor TAACCCT grant, there now exists an entire 5 course curriculum available to learners anywhere via the Internet to learn the latest version of QGIS.  This session will explore this curriculum and examine learning opportunities for professionals seeking knowledge and training in FOSS4G.</p>

        <h4>Augmented Reality for Hidden Assets</h4>
        <p>Every utility and government has millions invested in buried and/or hidden assets.  With the advancement of GIS we have more accurate location and information on these assets than ever before.  However, still in the field, the assets can be hidden by snow, vegetation, or even purposely in people’s property for aesthetics.  Additionally, despite accurate data, helping the field workers to find the right asset can be challenging, causing repairs and replacements to happen on the wrong assets.</p>
        <p>Technology has made another leap that can help, Augmented Reality.  We will introduce you to a new technology solution that can empower your field workers ‘in the last mile’ to find the correct hidden asset, plan their job, and effectively save time and effort.  We will also discuss how you can implement this into your organization.  Additionally, we will discuss the rapidly changing field of augmented reality and what the future might hold.  Augmented Reality is no longer a subject of science fiction and superhero movies.  It is here and available to improve all of our day to day jobs!</p>

        <h4>VOICE - Virtual Online Inspection Checking and Editing</h4>
        <p>There are many situations in which users, who may be vastly distributed geographically, require fast interactive access to large geospatial datasets.  These datasets are often comprised of high resolution imagery and LiDAR data.  A traditional approach for providing these products to users involves shipping hard drives which often results in long wait times.  This method is less than ideal since it exposes users to the potential risk of data versioning conflicts.</p>
        <p>Now, there have been several advances in cloud computing and new research in algorithms for managing large volumes of data.  Fusing these two enhancements together provides a practical, reliable and convenient alternative to the distribution of these datasets, while reducing the process friction of the traditional approach.  In this talk, we will outline how such solutions are developed using real-life examples drawn from the need to collaboratively and interactively assess the quality of both imagery and LiDAR data.</p>
