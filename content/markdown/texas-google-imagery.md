## How can Google Imagery help my organization?
The Texas Google Imagery Service serves 6-inch, natural color imagery for the state of Texas.
 
It provides state organizations with a current and consistent data source while offering the highest resolution imagery available for any statewide program through an OGC compliant Web Mapping Services (WMS).
 
Google hosts the Google imagery service through the Google Maps Engine.  It provides significant cost savings by streaming imagery directly to your GIS or application.  There is no need to pay large storage costs for serving Terrabytes of data.  
 
## Who can use the Google Imagery Services?
The Texas Google Imagery Service is a restricted license and is only for use by public organizations in the State of Texas (ie. state, regional and local governments).  Contractors for any public organization are permitted to use the imagery as long as the project or program is being performed directly in supports the public organization. 

Rights to use the imagery terminate upon completion of work by the outside entities. The sponsoring agency will need to request an imagery link on behalf of any contractor or outside 3rd party.
 
## I don’t use the Google Maps API, how do can I incorporate the services into my tools and applications?
Google Maps API provides access to the rich mapping content services from Google. Maps API is a commercial product that requires licensing based on quantities of use but is not required to access the Google Imagery Service.
 
The Texas Google Imagery Service is an open-standard service and can be incorporated into a wide variety of GIS software and web mapping applications that support open-standard formats such as the Esri suite of products, QGIS, or Global Mapper.
 
Check with your IT Department to determine if an OGC compliant Web Service is supported by your applications.
 
## How is the Texas Google Imagery Service different than the State Programs currently in place to acquire imagery such as the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) or the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP)?
The Texas Google Imagery Service is a mapping service that is available on-demand.  It is licensed, hosted, and served by Google.  It offers 6-inch resolution imagery, which is four times higher resolution than the 1/2-meter Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) imagery and approximately 16 times greater resolution than the 1-meter National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery.   
 
The imagery represented by the Texas Google Imagery Service is not in the public domain and is restricted under license.
 
## Will the state continue to pursue its own acquisition of statewide imagery such as the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) and National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP) partnerships?
Yes, TNRIS will continue to coordinate with the agency partners to determine the need and interest for a statewide public domain imagery dataset.
 
## How do I add the Google Imagery services to my desktop environment?
The Texas Google Imagery Service can be added as a layer into ArcGIS desktop. Instructions for this can be found at:

<a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/add-layers.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_C34EB22293D94DEAA28712CAF132A78B" class="btn btn-default btn-lg">How to add to ArcGIS online</a>
 
## What if my link stops working?
There may be times when links will be updated to allow for access of newly added imagery.  Most likely, your agency would have been notified about these updates.  The fastest way to know whether this is the reason for your non-functioning links is to check status updates at the top of this page:

 <a href="#project-updates" class="smooth-scroll"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> View Status Updates</a> 

These updates will provide link status updates, announcements, and instructions on how to reestablish your link.
 
If there is nothing on the portal page about any updates, please use the “contact TNRIS” and we will reactive your link.

</a> If you are working for a public organization in the State of Texas (ie. state, regional or local government) and would like to get a link, visit the request form using the button below.

<a class="btn btn-danger btn-lg" href="{{m.link('google-request')}}">

**Note:** Because the Texas Google Imagery Service is a restricted license, it can only for use by public organizations in the State of Texas.
 
Contractors or any individual working on behalf for a public organization are permitted to use the imagery as long as the work is being performed directly supports the public organization.  The sponsoring agency will need to request an imagery link on behalf of any contractor or outside or 3rd party.
 
 
## What do I do if I suspect that my link has been compromised or is being used by someone or an organization that is not authorized to use it?
If you feel that an unauthorized party has compromised your links, please contact TNRIS immediately.  We will disable your current links and re-establish new links for you to use.
 
## How do I know if and when new imagery has come on line?
To learn about new imagery or any updates to the Google imagery service, Please visit the status section at the top of this page. 

<a href="#project-updates" class="smooth-scroll"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> View Status Updates</a> 

We will continually update this section to provide the information and the history of all updates relating to the service.
 
## Do I need to refresh my service or get a new link to see new imagery?
No. Your current links should be updated automatically and always reflect the latest imagery.  However, in the pilot year, there may be some platform adjustments that will occur that would warrant the creation of new links.  For example, Google is phasing out the Google Maps Engine platform in favor of their Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  This change is expected to occur late in 2015 for Texas.  Once this happens, new links will need to be created for all users.  TNRIS will do our best to notify all users well before the change takes place so that you can plan accordingly. 
 
## What if I see errors or inconsistencies in the imagery?  How should I report it and to whom do I report it?
Use the button below to go to the Questions and Feedback form located on this page.
<a class="btn btn-default btn-lg smooth-scroll" href="#contact-pm">
<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> General Questions or Feedback
</a>

TNRIS will log these issues and work with Google staff to find solutions to correct them in future releases. 
 
## Can I download or get a physical copy of the original image that is in the service?
In the pilot year, copies of the imagery will be downloaded by TNRIS and made available to the contributing partners upon request.  The requesting agency would need to provide their own hard drives to TNRIS so that the copies can be made.   These images will be in JPG2000 format and will only be downloaded and distributed by TNRIS.  For additional information, please contact TNRIS directly.
 
After the pilot year, the image download may be done at an additional cost.  These details are still pending.  TNRIS is still working with the GIS governance council, DIR and Google to determine the process and costs for downloading imagery after the pilot year is over.

 
## Is it possible to get a Color Infrared (CIR) version of the imagery as a service?
Not at this time.  Google Imagery Service will only be serving out the natural color imagery for now.  The CIR version of the imagery is available for download in the pilot year.
 
After the pilot year, the CIR image download may be done at an additional cost.  These details are still pending.  TNRIS is still working with the GIS governance council, DIR and Google to determine the process and costs for downloading imagery after the pilot year is over.
 
 
## How can I get more information about upcoming flights in Texas?
To learn about upcoming flight in Texas and any other updates to the Google imagery service, Please visit the status section at the top of this page.

 <a href="#project-updates" class="smooth-scroll"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-right"></i> View Status Updates</a> 

This section will provide the information about the upcoming scheduled flights for specific areas in Texas. 
 
Please note that information in the Google flight schedules are used as general guidelines and may have several overriding factors such as weather conditions and conflicting schedules.  This information can change at any time.
 
 
## How do I know how much my organization has used the Google imagery service?
Because each agency is assigned their own specific URL for the Google Imagery Service, usage will be tracked for organizations by monitoring these URL’s.   TNRIS will provide a report at the beginning of each month to each participating agency to show how much their link was used and how it compares to the overall usage for the month.
