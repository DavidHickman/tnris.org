Many of us use Google imagery in our daily lives, but with this innovative project, the **Texas Natural Resources Information System**, the state's **Department of Information Resources (DIR)** and Google Imagery have collaborated to harness the resources of this, to provide a high-quality, cost-efficient, and widely accessible mapping resource that meets the needs of government agencies.

The **Texas Google Imagery Service Pilot Project** is higher quality than the consumer product.

Google Imagery is designed to provide a high resolution imagery service showing the entire state of Texas with its most current coverage. Google imagery provides continuous 6-inch natural color imagery for the entire state.

As a state provisioned service Google Imagery has two primary benefits:
1. Giving organizations the most current imagery for mapping.
2. Creating a consistent data source so any mapping performed will reflect the same underlying data as any other organization who uses it. This will keep maps for decision makers up to date and ahead of the consumer free imagery that is used by the public.

Making Google imagery available to all public agencies in Texas distributes the cost, making the imagery and the updates affordable to all.

### Who can use the Google Imagery Services?

The Texas Google Imagery Service is restricted for use by any public organization in the State of Texas. Stakeholders, and Contractors are permitted to use the imagery so long as it is for a specific project or program and terminates upon completion of work by these outside entities.

### I don’t use the Google Maps API, how do can I incorporate the services into my tools and applications? 

Google Maps API provides access to the rich mapping content services from Google. Maps API is a commercial product that requires licensing based on quantities of use but is not required to access the Google Imagery Service.

The Google Imagery Service is an open-standard service and can be incorporated into a wide variety of GIS software and web mapping applications that support open-standard formats such as the Esri suite of products, QGIS, or Global Mapper. 

### How is this different from those state imagery programs?

Google Imagery Service is a subscription service that is available on-demand. The Google Imagery Service offers a 6-inch resolution image which equates to roughly four times the resolution of the current TOP imagery and sixteen times the resolution of the NAIP imagery. In addition, the Google Imagery Service has built-in storage costs to help manage and maintain the 

### Will the state still be pursuing it’s own acquisition of Statewide Imagery such as the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) and National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP) partnerships?
