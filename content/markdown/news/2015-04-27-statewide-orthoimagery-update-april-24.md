  - Weather conditions were unfavorable this week, as such little imagery acquisition progress was made over the past week.
  - Two airplanes with ADS100 digital camera sensors are constantly monitoring the conditions to take advantage of any opportunity to acquire imagery.
  - Due to weather conditions and airspace restrictions affecting the overall project, the acquisition season end date for the entire state, Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4 was extended to April 30, 2015.
  - Quality Control data review has begun at TNRIS.
