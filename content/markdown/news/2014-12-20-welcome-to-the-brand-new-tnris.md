<p class="lead"><img class="pull-left" src="images/updates/new_website.jpg" alt="Small, 3-D pages of the new site stacked in front of each other">We're very excited to welcome you to latest version of the TNRIS site. We sincerely hope it meets your needs and expectations. While some of the content is similar to what you're used to, there are also new ways to explore and access TNRIS data.</p>

We'd love to hear from you as you browse the new site. Don't hesitate to [contact us](contact) and let us know if everything is working smoothly, tell us any if anything isn't looking right or even if you just want to give us some virtual high-fives.

Now on to what's new.

## Dive Deep into the Data Catalog

<p class="lead"><img class="pull-right" src="images/updates/new-website/catalog-sample.jpg" alt="a sample of the data catalog"> The most prominent addition to our site is the [Data Catalog](data-catalog). While much of the data has been available at TNRIS for some time, this is the first time that all of it has been catalogued and organized for easy access and exploration online.</p>

Each dataset has a clear template and samples of what data will look like, with descriptions, selected metadata and other details.

Included on each page are also all the ways the data can be accessed. You'll be able to tell right away if you can search and [download online](data-download) via our website; custom order through our [Research and Distribution](maps-and-data/research-and-distribution) services; or load the data as an [online map service](maps-and-data/online-mapping-services).

Across the site, you'll also run into data cards that link to data sets when they are referenced in articles or on other pages, so you'll know right away where to find the data that is being referred to.
{{m.catalog_data_card('elevation-lidar/capcog-2007-140cm')}}

In the near future, stay posted as we roll out more robust search functionality that will make exploring our data even easier.

## Bringing More to Our Front Page

<p class="lead">As always, we will keep you updated on the latest projects and features happening at TNRIS, but we hope you'll find a bigger picture of what's happening at TNRIS and around the state.</p>

The front page will be the portal to our latest major initiatives, from Imagery projects to the Texas GIS Forum. Our latest training courses will be available and we'll have more ...

### Data Spotlights Reveal the Story Behind Striking Data

As data geeks and map nerds, sometimes, we just want to share interesting images or maps that showcase data that tell a cool story.

We'd also love to invite our fellow geospatial data aficionados to share maps and data that they would like to highlight, especially from across our community of state agencies.

## Follow Statewide Geospatial Coordination Through the Geographic Information Office

TNRIS, as part of it's legislative mandate, is also the home of the state's Geographic Information Office.

Charged with maximizing the potential of GeoSpatial ...throughout the state, you can keep track of the publically open meetings, as well as catch updates regarding ongoing projects from the Director, Richard Wade, and Deputy Director, Felicia Retiz.
