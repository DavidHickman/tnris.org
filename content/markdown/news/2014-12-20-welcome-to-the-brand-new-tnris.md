<img class="pull-left" src="images/updates/new_website.jpg" alt="Small, 3-D pages of the new site stacked in front of each other">We're very excited to welcome you to latest version of the TNRIS site. While some of our content is similar to what you're used to, there are also new ways to explore and access TNRIS data. We hope it meets your needs and expectations. We'd love to hear from you as you browse the new site. Don't hesitate to [contact us](contact) and let us know if everything is working smoothly, if there fixes that need to happen or even if you just want to give us some virtual high-fives.

Now on to what's new.

## Dive Deep into the Data Catalog

<img class="pull-right" src="images/updates/new-website/catalog-sample.jpg" alt="a sample of the data catalog"> The biggest addition to our site is the new [Data Catalog](data-catalog). While much of the data has been available at TNRIS for some time, this is the first time that all of it has been catalogued and organized for easy access and exploration online.

Each dataset has a clear template and samples of what data will look like, with descriptions, selected metadata and other details.

Included on each page are also all the ways the data can be accessed. You'll be able to tell right away if you can search and [download online](data-download) via our website; custom order through our [Research and Distribution](maps-and-data/research-and-distribution) services; or load the data as an [online map service](maps-and-data/online-mapping-services).

In the near future, stay posted as we roll out more robust search functionality that will make exploring our data even easier.

We'd also love to invite our fellow geospatial data geeks to share ideas for images that they would like to highlight, especially from across our community of state agencies, or in the private sector.
