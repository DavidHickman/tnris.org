Thank you to all the attendees, presenters and sponsors who made the [2015 Texas GIS Forum](texas-gis-forum/2015/index) another successful event! TNRIS was proud to host all of you and make this important gathering happen again for the 28th year in a row.
 
Your support contributed to a record number of sponsors and overall attendance. Participation in the workshops, general sessions, and social event reached an all-time high of over 800 registrations.  Clearly the GIS Community in Texas is very much alive and well! 

Whether digging into the [Augmented Reality sandbox](news/2015-11-05-digging-into-augmented-reality-sandbox), tossing darts at the CartoDB social, or taking in innovative presentations and keynotes, we hope you enjoyed it all.
 
Weâ€™re reviewing the evaluations that so many of you completed. Your feedback is important to us and will be added to the planning for the 2016 Texas GIS Forum. 

Visit the [agenda](texas-gis-forum/2015/agenda) to view links to available presentations, and check back soon as we post video from the Keynotes in the coming weeks. See you next year!
