New high resolution lidar data is now available for all of Austin County and portions of surrounding counties to the north and west of Harris County. Aerial collection took place from January to March 2011 during the leaf-off season. AeroMetric performed data acquisition and processing with URS providing third-party quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC). 

The data were funded by the Floodplain Mapping Group in tandem with the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) and were procured through the Council on Competitive Governmentâ€™s High Priority Imagery and Datasets (HPIDS) contract.

The area of interest was selected based on statewide prioritization of floodplain mapping needs and in coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The project data were collected for floodplain mapping and engineering studies and are of sufficient precision to support a wide range of applications.
