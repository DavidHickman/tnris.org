The Texas Water Development Board has announced the Interactive 2012 State Water Plan at [www.texasstatewaterplan.org](http://www.texasstatewaterplan.org). As part of the TWDB, TNRIS developers played a key role in bringing the interactive mapping application to life. Along with other TWDB division staff, they built it using open source technologies. Keep an eye on the map as new features and information are rolled out, and stay tuned to TNRIS as we release more projects utilizing new tools and innovative approaches to data access.

**Check out the full press release from the TWDB below**

>As part of the Texas Water Development Board's ongoing efforts to promote awareness about water needs, the agency has launched an interactive website based on the 2012 State Water Plan. The website makes it easy for Texans to get details about water needs (also referred to as shortages or deficits) in multiple planning decades at the community, state, region, county and entity level.
  
>"This website is an example of the changes we are making to provide transparency to Texans about the important work TWDB does," said TWDB Chairman Carlos Rubinstein.

>Only projects that appear in the state water plan are eligible for funding from the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT) that was approved by Texas voters last November. This website will let water users statewide take an up-close look at data in the 2012 State Water Plan and how water needs in their communities change over time.

>"The data will offer communities critical information as they plan for projects to submit for SWIFT funding," said Board member Bech Bruun. "It's another way to get relevant information to those who want to get involved in the water planning process-something we strongly encourage all citizens to do."

>"The website also demonstrates the depth and scope of the data TWDB collects. We understand that sound planning must be based on good data and accurate science," said Board member Kathleen Jackson.

>The user-friendly website, which is also easily viewed on most mobile devices, currently shows the relative severity and projected water needs over the next 50 years. Future modules slated to be added to the website include population projections, water demand projections and specific strategies for creating additional water supplies.
