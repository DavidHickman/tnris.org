High resolution 6-inch aerial imagery are now available from TNRIS for Brazos County, portions of Burleson and Robertson Counties, and the City of Palestine. Six local entities contributed funds to collect the new imagery.
- Brazos Central Appraisal District
City of Bryan
•	City of College Station
•	City of Palestine
•	Texas A&M University
•	Texas Municipal Power Agency
Surdex Corp. was selected under the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) State contract as the orthoimagery data provider. The TNRIS Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) administered the project providing coordination and project management services. TNRIS also performed QA/QC for the project which included inspection of interim and final orthoimagery products.
The new orthoimagery are used for city engineering and planning, appraisal district valuations, university facilities management, infrastructure mapping, and other applications. 
The new orthoimagery were acquired in late January 2015 during leaf-off conditions. Leaf-off imagery allows the user to identify more on-the-ground features underneath deciduous tree cover than imagery acquired during full leaf-out. The difference between deciduous and evergreen vegetation is more apparent in imagery acquired during the leaf-off period.
DATA ACCESS
The orthoimagery files (GeoTIFF, JPEG2000) are in the public domain. The JPEG2000s are available for direct download.
