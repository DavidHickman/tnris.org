The Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) is pleased to announce the release of 5 foot contours for supported Lidar datasets in Texas.  Contours were created using Global mapper V.16 and were generated from digital elevation models (DEMs) for each corresponding Lidar dataset.

Sample spacing used to create contours is consistent with the nominal point spacing of the source LiDAR dataset from which it was derived.

Lines were automatically smoothed while being generated by Global Mapper. 

*Contours should be used for cartographic purposes only.* 

## Data Access

All 5ft Contours can be downloaded at quadrangle level on the data download page.

Large requests can be delivered through the RDC.
