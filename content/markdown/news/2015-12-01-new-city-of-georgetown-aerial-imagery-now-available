High resolution 6-inch aerial imagery are now available from TNRIS for the City of Georgetown and portions of Williamson, Bell, and Burnet Counties. This dataset is part of the 2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project as a BUY-UP higher resolution product with local contribution from the City of Georgetown Utilities to collect the new imagery.

Surdex Corp. was selected under the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) state contract as the orthoimagery data provider. The TNRIS Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) administered the project providing coordination and project management services. TNRIS also performed QA/QC for the project which included inspection of interim and final orthoimagery products.

The new orthoimagery are used for city engineering, planning and other applications. 

The new orthoimagery were acquired in early March 2015 during leaf-off conditions. Leaf-off imagery allows the user to identify more on-the-ground features underneath deciduous tree cover than imagery acquired during full leaf-out. The difference between deciduous and evergreen vegetation species is also easier to distinguish in leaf-off imagery.

## Data Access

The orthoimagery files (GeoTIFF, JPEG2000) are in the public domain. The JPEG2000s are available for direct download.
