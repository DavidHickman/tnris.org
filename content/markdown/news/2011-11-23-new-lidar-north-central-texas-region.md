The Texas Natural Resources Information System is pleased to announce the release of newly acquired high resolution lidar data for the Upper Trinity River Basin covering portions of Denton, Collin, Cooke, Grayson and Kaufman Counties in north Texas. Aerial collection took place from January to March 2011 during the leaf-off season. Merrick & Company performed data acquisition/processing with URS providing third-party quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC). 

The data were funded by the Floodplain Mapping Group in tandem with the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) and were procured through the Council on Competitive Governmentâ€™s High Priority Imagery and Datasets (HPIDS) contract.

This area of interest was selected based on statewide prioritization of floodplain mapping needs and coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The project data were collected primarily for flood analysis to assist in floodplain management and mapping activities in Texas, however, the specification exceeds FEMA standards, allowing for a wide range of study. 

## Products
- Classified all-return lidar DO3Q tiles (1/16th of USGS Quad) in LAS 1.2 format
- Ground point Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in IMG (ERDAS Imagine) format
- Lidar intensity images in TIF format
- Hydro-flattening breaklines in SHP
- File-level FGDC metadata in XML

## Acquisition Areas 

608 tiles covering all of Kaufman County, portions of Denton and Collin Counties not already covered from 2010 collection, and partial coverage of Cooke and Grayson Counties.
