High resolution lidar and associated data products are now available for portions of Sabine, Shelby and Newton Counties in East Texas. Aerial collection took place from January 12 to February 13, 2011 by MJ Harden (now PhotoScience) and Dewberry provided third-party quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC). The data were funded through collaboration between the Texas Natural Resources Information System and the Sabine River Authority (SRA). This project was procured through the Council on Competitive Governmentâ€™s High Priority Imagery and Datasets (HPIDS) contract. The area of interest was selected based on statewide prioritization of floodplain mapping needs and in coordination with SRA.

## Highlight Image

The image shows a 3-D lidar point cloud of the Toledo Bend Dam in Newton County. The points are categorized into ground points (brown), buildings (red), water (blue) and bridges (purple) with all remaining points shown as gray. The point cloud was then blended with a grayscale lidar-based image to provide a more photorealistic representation.
