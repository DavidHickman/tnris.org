Texas has communities of all sizes, from small rural towns to large metropolitan areas, and developing drought-proof water supplies for all Texans is not trivial. Texas Water Development Board’s (TWDB) funded projects range from conservation and reuse, to desalting groundwater and seawater, to building new pipelines, to developing reservoirs and well fields, and much more.

In 2013, the Texas Legislature authorized transferring $2 billion from the state's "Rainy Day Fund" to create a new loan program, later approved by Texas voters, to fund projects in the state water plan. This original investment in the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT) is designed to fund close to $27 billion in water supply projects over the next 50 years to ensure that Texas communities have adequate supplies of water during drought.

As part of faciliating the decision making process of where to focus water infrustructure and identifying the best method for funding those projects, TNRIS collaborated with the **Water Supply and Infrastructure (WSI)** office of the TWDB to bring together disparate data into an easily accessible mapping service.

### Loan or Grant? Water Funding Tied to Demographics
**Water Supply and Infrastructure (WSI)**, an office of the TWDB, is instrumental in making development decisions, particularly within the “Water Use, Projections, and Planning” section. They have to prioritize resources and make a variety of decisions based on conditions, need and availability. 

<p><div class="pull-quote right" title="A pull quote">WSI used to go through project applications looking for population and income data through the Census, American Community Survey (ACS)  and American Factfinder pages, <strong>one at a time</strong></div>Once a project is deemed necessary, other socioeconomic factors are considered to help decide between funding the project with a loan or a grant. A loan can be standard (at lower than market rates in most cases), subsidized and/or deferred. A loan can fund water-related infrastructure, including supply. Projects that are recommended water management strategies in the most recent approved State Water Plan associated with a capital cost are also funded through loans.</p>

On the other hand, a grant or a combination grant/loan can be used to bring water and wastewater services to economically distressed areas (designated by TWDB) where the present water and wastewater facilities are inadequate to meet the minimal needs of residents. The program includes measures to prevent future substandard development.

WSI used to go through project applications looking for population and income data through the Census, American Community Survey (ACS)  and American Factfinder pages, **one at a time**. With the implementation of [SWIFT - State Water Implementation Fund for Texas](http://www.twdb.texas.gov/swift/index.asp), this process needed more efficiency. Kevin Kluge from WSI visited with TNRIS Data and Mapping Solution’s staff and, appropriately, asked for a solution that would save them time.  

### Web Mapping Services Puts the Data in One Place
A **Web Map Service (WMS)** is a standard protocol for serving georeferenced map images over the Internet, first published by the Open Geospatial Consortium in 1999. While the concept of a WMS is not new, utilizing them to help the TWDB make funding decisions for water infrastructure is a fresh application of the tool.

For this application, the necessary data included: 
- Existing water systems
- TWDB projects under development
- Economic data such as mean and median income, household size and estimated number of households. 

Bringing all of this together, rather than referring to them in disparate systems, was the clear goal to streamline the process. After compiling the data, within a couple of weeks a Web Map Server prototype was developed.  

The WSI Map Viewer includes some GIS functionality and updated Web services and basemaps from ArcGIS Online. WMS is a widely supported format for maps and GIS data accessed via the Internet and loaded into client side GIS software. Major commercial GIS and mapping software that support WMS and also it can be used with nothing more than a browser, making it simple to disseminate to analysts and decision-makers.

WSI Personnel will be utilizing to help them make sound decisions. So far, WSI is evaluating the prototype and will follow up with suggested modifications. Those may include updating the data every year when new ACS data becomes available. In this way TWDB can help more Texas communities in a quicker way, by processing funding applications and making decisions about the loans or grants needs faster.
