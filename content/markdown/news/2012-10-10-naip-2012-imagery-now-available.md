The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial image data are now available. The 1 meter statewide orthoimagery are currently available for the Texas counties listed below and displayed in the NAIP 2012 Status Map. NAIP is administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City.

The primary goal of NAIP is to acquire digital orthoimagery of the continental U.S. during the agricultural growing season. The image products are made available to governmental agencies and the public within one year of acquisition. This “leaf-on” imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA’s County Service Centers and used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. NAIP data are also used widely across the state for a variety of purposes including natural resource assessment, asset management, and disaster response.
