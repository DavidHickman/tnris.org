The 2008-2009 Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) procured enhanced image products in the form of 50cm (0.5-meter) Digital Orthophoto Quarter-Quads (DOQQs) from the 2008 USDA-FSA National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and 2009 TOP aerial imagery acquisitions. The 2008-2009 TOP consists of a consortium of federal and state agencies including the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Commission on State Emergency Communications (CSEC), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Air Division and Facilities/Water Supply Division, the Texas General Land Office (GLO) through the Coastal Impact Assistance Program, and the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). The project is managed by the Texas Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap), a division of TNRIS and the Texas Water Development Board.

The 50cm DOQQs are in the public domain and available from TNRIS.

## Acquisition Areas

Under NAIP, 213 Texas counties were acquired in 2008 during leaf-on conditions. Under TOP, the remaining 41 East Texas counties were collected during leaf-off conditions in January 2009 to complete statewide coverage. The January 2009 acquisition also included 18 coastal counties that were previously collected during the leaf-on 2008 acquisition.

## Data Details

2008 leaf-on data were acquired April - October.
2009 leaf-off data were acquired in January.
4-band image data were collected at a ground sample distance of 0.75-meter and resampled to 0.50-meter spatial resolution. All data were acquired with the Leica Geosystems 2nd Generation ADS40 (Airborne Digital Sensor) system, SH52 (Sensor Head).
Horizontal accuracy specification is 3 - 5 meters to absolute ground control collected and compiled for this project.
Image data contain less than 10% cloud cover per DOQQ.
Orthorectified data are projected to the UTM NAD83 coordinate system. Data spans UTM zones 13, 14, and 15.
DOQQs are 8-bit and available in uncompressed GeoTIFF and compressed JPEG2000 (8:1) formats.
JPEG2000 DOQQs have significantly smaller file sizes, approximately 35MB compared to approximately 620MB for each GeoTIFF. Image quality is compromised when data are compressed. The visual difference is very slight with the JPEG2000 format, 8:1 compression ratio.
GeoTIFF and JPEG2000 DOQQs are available in two 3-band color composites, natural color (NC) and color infrared (CIR).
Viewing scales:
Minimum - 1:1,000
Optimal (near 1 to 1) - 1:2,000
Maximum (full extent) - 1:30,000
Tiling format is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter-quadrangle with a 150-meter buffer on all four sides. Shapefile indices are available for the dataset.
File naming convention is TNRISLetter DegreeBlock_7.5'Quad#_Quarter-Quad#_color combo_DDMMYYYY.format Ex: l2798_02_1_nc_29042008.jp2
Dataset level metadata are available in PDF and XML file formats.
For more information contact TNRIS Data Support.

## Known Issue

Older versions of geospatial mapping software, specifically CAD, may not support the JPEG2000 file format. For the most part, recent software releases include JPEG2000 compatibility. Information about a JPEG2000 plug-in for AutoCAD is available in ForAutoCadUsers.pdf.
