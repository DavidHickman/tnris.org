The [2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project](2015-statewide-orthoimagery-project) is one of our major ongoing data projects at TNRIS, in collaboration with the other state agency partners. It meets the important need for new high-quality, leaf-off imagery for the entire state. As part of our continued mission, all of the data produced from this project will be in the public domain and available from TNRIS through our [data download](data-download). We wanted to take an opportunity to catch ...

In 2013 we started gathering interest in new statewide orthoimagery flown during the leaf-off time period. In early 2014 we secured sufficient funds to release an RFO for statewide acquistion and selected [Surdex Corporation](https://www.surdex.net/) as the data provider.

With all that in place, we officially kicked off the project and began data acquistion, flying 91% of the state at 0..5 meter resolution between October 2014 and April 2015 to take advantage of leaf-off conditions. While the project has gone great, there have been issues that have changed our original expectations for completion. We go over these...

## Current Dataset Access

We have created a main entry for the 2015 Texas Orthoimager Program (TOP) in our [data catalog](data-catalog) for the imagery we've QC'ed and finalized so far. On a monthly basis we are adding an incorporating the latest final data into this dataset.

### 6-Inch and 1-Foot Buy-Up Areas

Our BUY-UP 6-inch and 1-foot areas were parts of the state sponsored by stakeholders seeking higher resolution imagery for their areas

 6,930 total square miles of 6-inch natural color and color infrared orthoimagery were independently QC’d and are now available for download for these areas:

## Acquisition Progress and Challenges

The project has gone really smoothly, especially due to the expertise of and collaboration with Surdex. We've flown 91% of the state and been able to process and release 36% of the dataset as of December.

But due to significant rainfall and cloudy weather (El Niño's fault of course), we were not able to meet the original stated completion date of September 2015, pushing us to expected full statewide data completion in Spring 2016.

Surdex will fly the remaining areas in the next leaf-off season, starting now in Dececmber 2015 through February 2016.

On the other hand, a more human-created issue has held up other parts of the state, namely, the border regions. In order to meet the image coverage requirements along the International Border, Surdex must fly 15-20 miles into Mexican territory. This requires a thorough permitting process in coordination with Mexican Government authorities.

## Focusing on Quality Control

The new natural color and color infrared orthoimagery are QC’d by TNRIS and volunteers to ensure a nearly flawless quality product to accommodate a wide variety of mapping applications for public and private users throughout the state.

## What’s next for 2016

*	Completion of the remaining areas to be flown (9% of Texas) concentrated in the South Texas region (Dec 2015 – Feb 2016).
*	TNRIS QC image inspection of Central, East, and South Texas
*	100% of the state as final orthoimagery delivered to TNRIS and available for download by Spring 2016.
*	BUY-UP 6-inch/1-foot areas:
  *	QC and final orthoimagery delivery and download availability of NGA/USGS areas – *Amarillo, Dallas-Ft. Worth, El Paso, Lubbock*
  *	Completion of remaining San Antonio River Authority area to be flown – 1-foot *Refugio* and *Aransas Counties*
