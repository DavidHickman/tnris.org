High resolution aerial imagery are now available for the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) and portions along the Texas/Mexico border. The imagery acquisition was initiated by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) and expanded to include nine (9) local LRGV cooperating partners: Brownsville Public Utilities Board, Hidalgo County Appraisal District, Laguna Madre Water District, and the Cities of Alton, Edinburg, McAllen, Pharr, Port Isabel, and San Benito. 

Tetra Tech, Inc. was selected under an IBWC contract as the data provider, and TNRIS assisted in coordination between the local partners and IBWC. The aerial imagery were acquired between December 2010 and April 2011 during leaf-off conditions. Orthoimagery quality review was performed by TNRIS for the areas funded by the LRGV partners.
