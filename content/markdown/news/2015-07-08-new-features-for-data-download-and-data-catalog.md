The TNRIS Information Services team has rolled out new features on our popular [Data Search & Download](data-download), as well as our growing [Data Catalog](data-catalog). Both have been enhanced to make finding the data you need easier than ever.

## Dynamic Search Map for Locating Your Data

We're very excited to debut a dynamic search map on our [Data Search and Download](data-download).

Instead of static images, a web-based map is used to show the state, counties and quads.

Users can swiftly jump from statewide datasets, to their desired county, and if necessary, to their desired quad. At the quad level, clicking on adjacent quads is also possible.

At each level, the available datasets are quickly populated on the page.

## Expanding the Catalog with Outside Sources 

The [Data Catalog](data-catalog) showcases each available dataset at TNRIS. Now it is expanding to include datasets hosted by other state agencies, with an eventual goal of providing a centralized hub for public datasets for the State of Texas.

The first third-party data holdings we've incorporated belong to our own parent agency, the [Texas Water Development Board (TWDB)](http://www.twdb.texas.gov).

### Some new datasets include:

{{m.catalog_data_card('hydrography/twdb-existing-reservoirs')}}

{{m.catalog_data_card('boundary/twdb-regional-water-planning-areas-rwpa')}}

If you and your agency would like to be included in the Data Catalog, please [contact us](contact).

## Dynamic Coverage Maps

Building on the Data Catalog as well, we've incorporated dynamic coverage maps that provide an immediate idea of whether the dataset covers your desired area.

We hope that the new features meet the expectations of our dedicated users. We welcome any [feedback and suggestions](contact) for how we can keep improving the site and continue to meet your needs.
