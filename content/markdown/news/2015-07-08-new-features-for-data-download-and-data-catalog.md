The TNRIS Information Services team has rolled out new features on our popular [Data Search & Download](data-download), as well as our growing [Data Catalog](data-catalog). We've enhanced both in order to make finding your data easier than ever.

## Improved Search Map for Locating Your Data

We're very excited to debut a dynamic search map on our [Data Search and Download](data-download).

Static images are now replaced with a web-based map that allows the search to move from statewide to county-level, and then down to 7.5 minute quadâ€“level. At the quad level, clicking on adjacent quads is also possible.

At each level, the available datasets are quickly populated on the page.

## Expanding the Catalog with More Sources 

The [Data Catalog](data-catalog) showcases each available dataset at TNRIS. The goal is to expand and provide a centralized hub for public geospatial datasets for the State of Texas.

New datasets include authoritative source data from the [Texas Water Development Board (TWDB)](http://www.twdb.texas.gov).

### Some new datasets include:

{{m.catalog_data_card('hydrography/twdb-existing-reservoirs')}}

{{m.catalog_data_card('boundary/twdb-regional-water-planning-areas-rwpa')}}

[Contact Us](contact) to add your agency data to the TNRIS Data Catalog now.

## Dynamic Coverage Maps

Building on the Data Catalog as well, we've incorporated dynamic coverage maps that provide an immediate idea of whether the dataset covers your desired area.

We hope that these new features meet the expectations of our dedicated users. We welcome any [feedback and suggestions](contact) for how we can keep improving the site and continue to meet your needs.
