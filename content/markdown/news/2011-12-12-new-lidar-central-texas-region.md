Additional newly acquired high resolution lidar data collected by Merrick & Company is now available and covers portions of Blanco, Caldwell, DeWitt, Gonzales, Kendall and Kerr Counties in central Texas. Aerial collection took place from January to March 2011 during the leaf-off season. URS provided third-party quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC).

The data were funded by the Floodplain Mapping Group in tandem with the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) and were procured through the Council on Competitive Governmentâ€™s High Priority Imagery and Datasets (HPIDS) contract.

This area of interest was selected based on statewide prioritization of floodplain mapping needs and coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 

The project data were collected primarily for flood analysis to assist in floodplain management and mapping activities in Texas, however, the specification exceeds FEMA standards, allowing for a wide range of study.

## Products
- Classified all-return lidar DO3Q tiles (1/16th of USGS Quad) in LAS 1.2 format
- Ground point Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in IMG (ERDAS Imagine) format
- Lidar intensity images in TIF format
- Hydro-flattening breaklines in SHP
- File-level FGDC metadata in XML

## Acquisition Areas 
802 tiles covering the majority of Gonzales, Kendall and Kerr Counties, large portions of Blanco and Caldwell Counties not already covered from a 2008/2009 CAPCOG collection, and partial coverage of DeWitt, Bandera and Gillespie Counties.
