We are excited to share a video produced by our agency, the [Texas Water Development Board](http://www.twdb.texas.gov/), featuring Miguel Pavon, an integral part of the TNRIS team. Miguel leads the [Data & Mapping Solutions Center](maps-and-data/data-and-mapping-solutions) team, which applies design, communication, and technology to provide data solutions and cartographic products to the geographic information systems (GIS) communities of Texas, the Texas/Mexico border and beyond.

Watch the video to learn more about Miguel's background and how he helps us provide the best geospatial services possible to the people of Texas.
