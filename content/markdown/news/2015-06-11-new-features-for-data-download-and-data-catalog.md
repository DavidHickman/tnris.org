   Dynamic map searching has been added to Data Search & Download, and new datasets and features have enhanced the Data Catalog

The TNRIS Information Services team has rolled out new features on our popular Data Search & Download, as well as our growing Data Catalog. Both have been enhanced to make finding the data you need easier than ever.

## Dynamic Search Map for Locating Your Data

We're very excited to debut a Dynamic search map on our [Data Search and Download](data-download).

Instead of static images, a web-based map is used to show the state, counties and quads.

Users can swiftly jump from statewide datasets, to their desired county, and right to their desired quad. At each level, the available datasets are quickly populated on the page.

## Not Just TNRIS in the Data Catalog

The [Data Catalog](data-catalog) showcases each available dataset at TNRIS. Now it is expanding to include datasets hosted by other state agencies, with an eventual goal of providing a centralized hub for public datasets for the State of Texas.

The first third-party data holdings we're incorporating into the catalog belong to our own parent agency, the [Texas Water Development Board (TWDB)](http://www.twdb.texas.gov).

### Some new datasets include:

{{m.catalog_data_card('hydrography/twdb-existing-reservoirs')}}

{{m.catalog_data_card('boundary/twdb-regional-water-planning-areas-rwpa')}}

and many others.

If you and your agency would like to be included in the Data Catalog, please [contact us](contact).

## Dynamic Coverage Maps

Also a new addition to the Data Catalog, we've incorporated dynamic coverage maps that provide an immediate idea of whether the data covers your desired area.

We hope that the new features meet the expecations of our dedicated users. We greatly welcome any feedback and suggestions for how we can continue to improve the site and continue meeting your needs.
