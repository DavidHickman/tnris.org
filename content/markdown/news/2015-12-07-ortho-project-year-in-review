#2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project Year in Review

##In 2015
From October 2014 through April 2015, 91% of Texas was flown during leaf-off conditions for new 0.5-meter orthoimagery for the 2015 project, part of the Texas Orthoimagery Program administered by TNRIS. All orthoimagery products acquired through this project are in the public domain and available from TNRIS.

The new natural color and color infrared orthoimagery are QC’d by TNRIS and volunteers to ensure a nearly flawless quality product to accommodate a wide variety of mapping applications for public and private users throughout the state.

BUY-UP 6-inch and 1-foot orthoimagery for select areas were flown January through March 2015 during leaf-off conditions. 6,930 total square miles of 6-inch natural color and color infrared orthoimagery were independently QC’d and are now available for download for these areas:

##Challenges for the project in 2015
*	Day after day of rainfall and cloudy conditions caused a delay in 0.5-meter statewide image acquisition during leaf-off conditions. As such the remaining areas were pushed to the next leaf-off season (Dec 2015 – Feb 2016).

*	An unexpected and thorough permitting process to fly across the TX/MX border to capture imagery to meet the image coverage requirements along the International Border.

##What’s next for 2016
*	Completion of the remaining areas to be flown (9% of Texas) concentrated in the South Texas region (Dec 2015 – Feb 2016).
*	TNRIS QC image inspection of Central, East, and South Texas
*	100% of the state as final orthoimagery delivered to TNRIS and available for download by Spring 2016.
*	BUY-UP 6-inch/1-foot areas:
  *	QC and final orthoimagery delivery and download availability of NGA/USGS areas – *Amarillo, Dallas-Ft. Worth, El Paso, Lubbock*
  *	Completion of remaining San Antonio River Authority area to be flown – 1-foot *Refugio* and *Aransas Counties*
