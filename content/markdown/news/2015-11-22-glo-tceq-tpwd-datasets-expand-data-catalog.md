   The TNRIS Data Catalog has been updated with entries for GLO, TCEQ, and TPWD datasets.
---
As part of our efforts to create the most comprehensive and easy to use clearinghouse for publicly available data for the State of Texas, TNRIS has added data catalog entries for the [Texas General Land Office (GLO)](http://www.glo.texas.gov/), [Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)](http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/), and [Texas Parks & Wildlife (TPWD)](http://tpwd.texas.gov/).

In total, 53 datasets have been added in this push.

While we host datasets with these agencies created in collaboration TNRIS - for example the [TPWD 2015 Galveston State Park](https://tnris.org/data-catalog/entry/tpwd-2015-galveston-state-park/) dataset - the recently added datasets are not hosted on TNRIS servers, but hosted at each agency's respective site. We provide direct download links

Their entry in the data catalog helps consolidate data for the State of Texas and make it easier for all those seeking public data.
