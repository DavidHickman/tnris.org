   The TNRIS Data Catalog has been updated with entries for GLO, TCEQ, and TPWD datasets.
---
As part of our efforts to create the most comprehensive and easy to use clearinghouse for publicly available data for the State of Texas, TNRIS has added many data catalog entries for the [Texas General Land Office (GLO)](http://www.glo.texas.gov), [Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)](http://www.tceq.state.tx.us), and [Texas Parks & Wildlife (TPWD)](http://tpwd.texas.gov).

In total, 53 datasets have been added in this push. Visit the [data catalog](data-catalog) to start exploring.

While we create some datasets in collaboration with these agencies and host them on TNRIS servers - for example the [TPWD 2015 Galveston State Park](data-catalog/entry/tpwd-2015-galveston-state-park) dataset - the recently added datasets are not hosted on TNRIS servers, but hosted at each agency's respective site. We provide basic information about each dataset and links to directly download the data or preview it where available.

Their entry in the TNRIS data catalog works towards consolidating geospatial data for the State of Texas and make it easier for all those seeking publicly data.

Below, we've highlighted a few of the datasets from each agency that have been added. For all the new datasets, visit the TNRIS [data catalog](data-catalog).
