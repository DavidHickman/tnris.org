   The TNRIS Data Catalog has been updated with entries for GLO, TCEQ, and TPWD datasets.
---
The [TNRIS data catalog](data-catalog) now includes 53 new datasets that are
published by some of our partners at the State of Texas: the [Texas General Land
Office (GLO)](http://www.glo.texas.gov), the [Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (TCEQ)](http://www.tceq.state.tx.us), and the [Texas Parks & Wildlife
Department (TPWD)](http://tpwd.texas.gov).

With these additions, we are expanding the catalog to include important datasets
published and hosted outside of TNRIS as part of our ongoing efforts to help
people find and use public data. The [data catalog](data-catalog) previously
only included datasets hosted by TNRIS on the web or available by order from
our archives.

Here are just a few of the datasets from each agency that have been added.

{{m.catalog_data_card('tpwd-state-park-boundaries')}}

<p class="lead">We will continue working on the catalog to make it easier to
discover and access data, so keep watching for new datasets and improvements.
Please don't hesitate to [contact us](contact) with your own ideas and
recommendations.</a></p>
