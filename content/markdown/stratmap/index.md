abstract: The Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) was established in 1997 by Senate Bill 1 to develop consistent statewide digital data layers.

<p class="lead">StratMap's primary goal is to acquire and improve digital geographic data for statewide mapping applications. StratMap also maintains comprehensive data standard specifications to ensure consistent, high quality data products across the State.</p>

StratMap personnel at TNRIS work with multiple agencies on cost-share initiatives in order to provide the State of Texas with best value data products. 

How does this work? The StratMap team communicates regularly with State, Federal, regional and local government entities to discuss mapping needs. New projects are formed by identifying type of data required, location, specification, budget and timeline for delivery. Data acquisition, production and independent quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) are awarded to private geospatial contractors through the Texas Strategic Mapping Contract. After the final data deliverables are accepted, they are placed in the public domain for use by local, regional and federal government, academia, private industry and the public.

StratMap Program direct funding over time

## Orthoimagery

<p class="lead">Orthoimagery is digital aerial photography that has been geometrically corrected (orthorectified) to remove distortion caused by camera optics, aircraft tilt, and differences in ground elevation. 
</p>

This data layer at 1-meter and 0.5-meter pixel resolution is used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base of reference for other map information. 

Leveraging State funds from multiple agencies, the StratMap Program coordinated statewide orthoimagery acquisitions starting in the mid-1990s. Since then, the state has been refreshed with new orthoimagery in 2004, 2008/09, and 2010, all in conjunction with the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) administered by the USDA-Farm Service Agency-Aerial Photography Field Office. NAIP continues to refresh Texas statewide with new orthoimagery every two years (2012, 2014) during the leaf-on growing season (April – October acquisitions). Pooling State funds again in 2014, StratMap coordinated a new statewide leaf-off acquisition to occur during the 2014/15 winter season.

Since 2009, using the [High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS)](high-priority-imagery-data-sets) contract, StratMap has coordinated numerous higher resolution (6-inch/1-foot) orthoimagery regional acquisition projects within Texas.

## Elevation (LiDAR)

<p class="lead">Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a technology that utilizes lasers to measure the distance from an airborne sensor (such as an airplane) to points on the ground. </p>

This creates an accurate 3-dimensional representation of the earth’s surface. LiDAR goes beyond traditional bare earth digital elevation models (DEMs) by producing point cloud information that can be classified into existing features such as vegetation and man-made structures.

TNRIS acquires LiDAR data through partnerships with other federal and state agencies as well as through our high priority imagery and data sets(HPIDS) contract to make this data available to the public. LiDAR coverage varies across the state. LiDAR coverage and project details (date, nps, vendor, etc.) can be found on the LiDAR Status Map . All details about each dataset in our collection can be found in the QAQC for each project (see below).

All LiDAR datasets are available for purchase by filling out an order form*

## History

In the mid-1990s, the Strategic Mapping Program was established at TNRIS and funded by the Texas Legislature and other partners (state agencies, federal agencies, local entities) to include statewide GIS layers for seven specific data types: <strong>Orthoimagery</strong>, <strong>Elevation</strong>, <strong>Hydrography</strong>, <strong>Political Boundaries</strong>, <strong>Transportation</strong>, <strong>Soils</strong>.

While the StratMap Program is active in acquiring new Orthoimagery, Elevation, and Hydrography data today, relevant Political Boundaries, Transportation, and Soils layers are maintained by outside agencies but still available through the TNRIS Data Catalog.
