The Department of Information Resources (DIR) established a procurement contract designed to strengthen Texas’ capabilities to purchase quality digital map data for both government and the public. The new process employs a state Master Contract commonly known as the Strategic Mapping (StratMap) Contract. The Texas Natural Resources Information System administers the StratMap Contract.

## How does this work?
New data acquisition projects are determined by identifying type of data required, location, specification, budget and timeline for delivery. Data acquisition, production and independent quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) responsibilities are awarded to private geospatial contractors through the Department of Information Resources (DIR) Contract. After the final deliverables are accepted, the data are placed in the public domain.

## Benefits

- #### Strategic Collaboration and Integration
    Combined professional expertise to enhance project specifications resulting in better data products. Working together generates new ideas for creating <span></span>marter geospatial data that can be used by many organizations. If desired, we will help you select the company that will best suit your needs.

- #### Taxpayer Value
    By combining our geospatial projects, we can acquire a larger area at a discounted unit price and reduce duplication.

- #### Efficient Purchasing Process
    Because the contract with each pre-qualified vendor is already in place, a contract between you and the vendor is not required. A statement of work and a purchase order referencing the vendor's DIR (StratMap) Contract will suffice.

- #### Project Assistance and Coordination
    There are several options ranging from self service to full service. We can help you seek additional project partners to expand the area of interest or to share the project cost.

- #### Continuous Improvement
    Each project performed under the StratMap Contract provides valuable experience that helps to improve data standards and overall project management.

- #### Increased Opportunity for Cost Sharing
    By notifying us about a potential project, you may be alerted to another entity interested in purchasing a similar product or area of interest.

- #### Pre-screened Companies with Geospatial experience
    Each of the selected companies were carefully evaluated for project experience and success. Qualifications include project experience, technology innovation, professional staff, and available resources.
