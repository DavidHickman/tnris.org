<p class="lead">The <a href="http://dir.texas.gov/">Department of Information Resources (DIR)</a> has established a procurement contract designed to strengthen Texas’ capabilities to purchase quality digital map data for both government and the public. The new process employs a state Master Contract, administered by TNRIS, commonly known as the <strong>Texas Strategic Mapping (StratMap) Contract</strong>. This contract is the successor to the 2009-2015 <a href="{{m.link('high-priority-imagery-data-sets')}}">High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) Contract</a>.</p>
 
<p class="lead">The StratMap Contract was signed by companies who have been evaluated and pre-qualified by a team of GIS professionals to <strong>provide quality geographic data products, services,</strong> and <strong>GIS software</strong> to public agencies in Texas. It has been developed to streamline the procurement process for future acquisitions of geographic data, software, and services and provide beneficial competition among the best companies in the industry.

<h2>How does this work?</h2>

<p><ul class="stratmap-work">
<li><strong>New data acquisition projects</strong> are determined by identifying type of data required, location, specification, budget and timeline for delivery.</li> 
<li><strong>Data acquisition, production and independent quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC)</strong> responsibilities are awarded to private geospatial contractors through the Department of Information Resources (DIR) Contract. </li>
<li><strong>After the final data deliverables are accepted</strong>, they are placed in the public domain for use by local, regional and federal government, academia, private industry and the public.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>What are the Benefits?</h2>

<h3>Strategic Collaboration and Integration</h3>
<p>Bringing together professional expertise across the geospatial community enhances project specifications and results in better data products.</p>

<h3>Taxpayer Value</h3>
<p>By combining our geospatial projects, we can acquire a larger area at a discounted unit price and reduce duplication.</p>

<h3>Efficient Purchasing Process</h3>
<p>Because the contract with each pre-qualified vendor is already in place, a contract between you and the vendor is not required. A statement of work and a purchase order referencing the vendor's DIR (StratMap) Contract will suffice.</p>

<h3>Project Assistance and Coordination</h3>
<p>There are several options ranging from self service to full service. We can help you seek additional project partners to expand the area of interest or to share the project cost.</p>

<h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
<p>Each project performed under the StratMap Contract provides valuable experience that helps to improve data standards and overall project management.</p>

<h3>Increased Opportunity for Cost Sharing</h3>
<p>By notifying us about a potential project, you may be alerted to another entity interested in purchasing a similar product or area of interest.</p>

<h3>Pre-screened Companies with Geospatial experience</h3>
<p>Each of the selected companies were carefully evaluated for project experience and success. Qualifications include project experience, technology innovation, professional staff, and available resources.</p>
