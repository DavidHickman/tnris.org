<pThe <a href="http://dir.texas.gov/">Department of Information Resources (DIR)</a> with assistance from the <a href="http://www.twdb.texas.gov/">Texas Water Development Board (TWDB</a>, released a solicitation for the Texas Strategic Mapping (StratMap) Contract, the successor contract to the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) Contract.</p>
 
The DIR contract will be signed by companies who have been evaluated and pre-qualified by a team of GIS professionals to provide quality geographic data products, services, and GIS software to public agencies in Texas. It has been developed to streamline the procurement process for future acquisition of geographic data, software, and services and provide beneficial competition among the best companies in the industry.
 
Respondents will have thirty (30) days to submit proposals and a non-mandatory meeting is expected to occur on October 30, 2015.

The Council on Competitive Government (CCG) established a procurement contract designed to strengthen Texas’ capabilities to purchase quality digital map data for both government and the public. The new process employs a state Master Contract commonly known as High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS).

New data acquisition projects are determined by identifying type of data required, location, specification, budget and timeline for delivery.  Data acquisition, production and independent quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) responsibilities are awarded to private geospatial contractors through the Council on Competitive Government (CCG) High Priority Imagery and Data Sets Contract.  After the final deliverables are accepted, the data are placed in the public domain.

## Benefits

- #### Strategic Collaboration and Integration

    Combined professional expertise to enhance project specifications resulting in better data products. Working together generates new ideas for creating <span></span>marter geospatial data that can be used by many organizations. If desired, we will help you select the company that will best suit your needs.

- #### Taxpayer Value

    By combining our geospatial projects, we can acquire a larger area at a discounted unit price and reduce duplication.

- #### Efficient Purchasing Process

    Since the contract with the vendors is already in place, a contract between you and the vendor not required. A statement of work and a purchase order will suffice.

- #### Project Assistance and Coordination
    There are several options ranging from self service to full service. We can help you seek additional project partners to expand the area of interest or to share the project cost.

- #### Continuous Improvement
    Each project performed under the HPIDS Contract takes away valuable experiences that help improve data standards and overall project management.

- #### Increased Opportunity for Cost Sharing
    By notifying us about a potential project, you may be alerted to another entity interested in purchasing a similar product or area of interest.

- #### Pre-screened Companies with Geospatial experience
    Each of the selected companies were carefully evaluated for project experience and success. Qualifications include large scale project experience, technology innovation, professional staff, and available resources.
