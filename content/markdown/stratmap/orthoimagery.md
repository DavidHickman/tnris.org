An orthoimagery data layer at 1-meter and 0.5-meter pixel resolution is used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base of reference for other map information. 

Leveraging State funds from multiple agencies, the StratMap Program coordinated statewide orthoimagery acquisitions starting in the mid-1990s. Since then, the state has been refreshed with new orthoimagery in 2004, 2008/09, and 2010, all in conjunction with the [National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)](http://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/) administered by the USDA-Farm Service Agency-Aerial Photography Field Office. 

NAIP continues to refresh Texas statewide with new orthoimagery every two years (2012, 2014) during the leaf-on growing season (April â€“ October acquisitions). Pooling State funds again in 2014, StratMap coordinated a new statewide leaf-off acquisition to occur during the 2014/15 winter season.

Between 2009 and 2015, using the [High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS)](high-priority-imagery-data-sets) contract, StratMap has coordinated numerous higher resolution (6-inch/1-foot) orthoimagery regional acquisition projects within Texas. Future datasets will be acquired under the [StratMap Contract](stratmap/stratmap-contract)
