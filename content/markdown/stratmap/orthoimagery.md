The publicly available statewide orthoimagery datasets from TNRIS have either 0.5-meter or 1-meter pixel resolution. This level of image detail is used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base of reference for other map information. 

Leveraging funds from multiple government agencies (State, Federal, and Local), the StratMap Program coordinated statewide orthoimagery acquisitions starting in the mid-1990s. Since then, the state has been refreshed with new orthoimagery in 2004 at 1-meter, 2008/09 at 0.5-meter & 1-meter, and 2010 at 1-meter, all in conjunction with the [National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)](http://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/) administered by the USDA-Farm Service Agency-Aerial Photography Field Office. NAIP continues to refresh Texas statewide with new orthoimagery every two years at 1-meter pixel resolution (2012, 2014) during the leaf-on growing season (April â€“ October acquisitions). 

Pooling State funds again in 2014, StratMap coordinated a new statewide 0.5-meter leaf-off acquisition that occurred during the 2014/15 (91% of state) & 2015/16 (9% of state) winter seasons.

Since 2009, the StratMap Program has coordinated numerous higher resolution (6-inch/1-foot) orthoimagery regional acquisition projects within Texas. A contracting vehicle called the [StratMap Contract](stratmap/stratmap-contract) provides an efficient way to procure new orthoimagery from a list of prequalified geospatial data product and services vendors.
