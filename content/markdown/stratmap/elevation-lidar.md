<p class="lead"><strong>LIDAR - Light Detection and Ranging,</strong> is a remote sensing technique that utilizes light in the form of a rapidly pulsed laser to measure return distances from the Earth captured by a sensor at the source of the pulse. These combined pulse return measurements with additional spatial and temproral data recorded by the acquisition system(airborne or terrestial) produce a three-dimensional(3-D), detailed representation of the shape of the Earth illuminating its surface characteristics.</p>

This creates an accurate 3-dimensional representation of the earth’s surface. LiDAR goes beyond traditional bare earth digital elevation models (DEMs) by producing point cloud information that can be classified into existing features such as vegetation and man-made structures.

TNRIS acquires LiDAR data through partnerships with other federal and state agencies historically through the high priority imagery and data sets(HPIDS) contract and now through the Department of Information Resources(DIR) StratMap contract to make this data available to the public. LiDAR coverage varies across the state. LiDAR coverage and project details (date, nps, vendor, etc.) can be found on the [LiDAR Status Map](https://tnris-twdb.cartodb.com/u/tnris/viz/41bcf87c-0248-11e6-b572-0e31c9be1b51/public_map) . All details about each dataset in our collection can be found in the supplemental reports for each project (see below).

All LiDAR datasets are available at reproduction cost through our Research and Distribution center. They can be obtained by filling out an order form*
