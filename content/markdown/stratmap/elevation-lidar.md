<p class="lead">Lidar technology creates an accurate 3-dimensional representation of the earth’s surface. LiDAR goes beyond traditional bare earth digital elevation models (DEMs) by producing point cloud information that can be classified into existing features such as vegetation and man-made structures.</p>

TNRIS acquires LiDAR data through partnerships with other federal and state agencies as well as through our high priority imagery and data sets(HPIDS) contract to make this data available to the public. LiDAR coverage varies across the state. LiDAR coverage and project details (date, nps, vendor, etc.) can be found on the LiDAR Status Map . All details about each dataset in our collection can be found in the QAQC for each project (see below).

All LiDAR datasets are available for purchase by filling out an order form*
