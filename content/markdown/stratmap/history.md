<p class="lead">In the mid-1990s, the Strategic Mapping Program was established at TNRIS and funded by the Texas Legislature and other partners (state agencies, federal agencies, local entities) to include statewide GIS layers for <strong>seven specific data types</strong>.</p>

<p class="lead">While our structure and activities have evolved, the original charge of maintaining, creating and facilitating the acquisition of up-to-date data available for the public of Texas is still the foundation of the StratMap Program.</p>

## The Original Seven Layers of StratMap

### Orthoimagery
{{m.catalog_data_card('texas-orthoimagery-program-top-1996-cir-bw-1m')}}

### Elevation
{{m.catalog_data_card('national-elevation-dataset-ned-2004')}}

{{m.catalog_data_card('stratmap-hypso')}}

### Hydrography
{{m.catalog_data_card('national-hydrography-dataset-nhd')}}

### Political Boundaries
{{m.catalog_data_card('political-boundaries')}}

### Transportation
{{m.catalog_data_card('stratmap-transportation')}}

### Soils
{{m.catalog_data_card('soils')}}

While the StratMap Program is active in acquiring new Orthoimagery, Elevation, and Hydrography data today, relevant Political Boundaries, Transportation, and Soils layers are maintained by outside agencies but still available through the [TNRIS Data Catalog](data-catalog).
