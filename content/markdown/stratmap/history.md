<p class="lead">In the mid-1990s, the Strategic Mapping Program was established at TNRIS and funded by the Texas Legislature and other partners (state agencies, federal agencies, local entities) to include statewide GIS layers for <strong>seven specific data types</strong>: </p>

### Orthoimagery
{{m.catalog_data_card('texas-orthoimagery-program-top-1996-cir-bw-1m')}}

### Elevation
{{m.catalog_data_card('national-elevation-dataset-ned-2004')}}

{{m.catalog_data_card('stratmap-hypso')}}

### Hydrography
{{m.catalog_data_card('national-hydrography-dataset-nhd')}}

### Political Boundaries

### Transportation
{{m.catalog_data_card('stratmap-transportation')}}

### Soils
{{m.catalog_data_card('soils')}}

While the StratMap Program is active in acquiring new Orthoimagery, Elevation, and Hydrography data today, relevant Political Boundaries, Transportation, and Soils layers are maintained by outside agencies but still available through the [TNRIS Data Catalog](data-catalog).
