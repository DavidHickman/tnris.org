### Imagery for Texas	
#### Gayla Mullins

Final data from the 2015 Texas Orthoimagery Project (TOP) captured at 0.5-meter resolution during the 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 winter seasons is near completion and has been delivered in full to TNRIS. The southernmost tip of Texas is the most recent delivery to TNRIS and will be made available for download from the TNRIS website in about two weeks along with the exisiting data for the rest of the state. The TOP imagery is also being shared with the Esri Community Imagery Program. Imagery is gradually appearing in the Esri imagery basemap available in Arc products starting now. Check the [project website](https://tnris.org/2015-statewide-orthoimagery-project/) for additional updates and data download and WMS connection information.
The Buy-Up areas at 6-inch/1-foot resolution are also complete and available and in various stages of download and WMS access. See chart on slide 10 of the QtrlyMtg2_2016.pdf
All products from the 2015 TOP project are 4-band and in the public domain.

### NAIP 2016
#### Gayla Mullins

The National Agriculture Imagery Program will fly Texas during the 2016 growing season (May - October) at 1-meter resolution. The final product will be 4-band and in the public domain. NAIP is managed by the USDA-Aerial Photography Field Office.

### StratMap Contract Update	
#### Gayla Mullins

Contracts have been signed by a few of the 17 companies currently under negotiation and are ready for use by state agencies and other public entities for GIS products, services, and software. TNRIS is working on a dedicated StratMap Contract web page that will contain information regarding use of the contract, list of contractors, and links to contractor sites. The contracts are held at the Department of Information Resources (DIR).

### South Central Texas Lidar	
#### Joey Thomas

Still on track to collect lidar in south central Texas this next leaf-off season. Contributing partner list is growing and we expect the USGS will announce the opening for grant proposals sometime this summer. A meeting to discuss the grant proposal will be held soon.

#### Scot Friedman
Working on web apps, mobile apps, offshore structures inventory in state waters, oil spill toolkit (next release scheduled for September), boat ramps. With the recent removal of parcel data from Google Earth, GLO has worked on collecting parcels from county appraisal districts. Close to finalizing agreement with City of Corpus Christi for their parcel data. Parcel data is needed by the beach team for permitting. Need centralized parcel data at least for coastal counties and would like to see a service provided by TNRIS.

GIS programmer analyst position with GLO will be posted soon. GIS team interested in Infogroup data. Kam coming May 3 and will coordinate to have the meeting with TNRIS.

Working on conservation areas indices. Have a little money to refine some of the VegMap areas, working with NPS in the South Padre Island area. Got funding for plant ecologist to focus on prairie/grassland areas – intensively visit areas of the state for grassland monitoring. Maybe use lidar for. Still need additional funding for more Veg mapping refinement and seagrass mapping.
