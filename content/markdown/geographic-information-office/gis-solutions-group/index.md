<p class="lead">The Texas Natural Resources Information System, along with the [Texas Department of Information Resources](http://dir.texas.gov/View-About-DIR/Data-Center/Landing.aspx), established the Data Center Services (DCS) GIS Solutions Group to help address the complexities of geographic information systems in the state. The Solutions Group provides a platform for sharing information and making unified decisions that will better serve geographic information departments at state agencies. The DCS GIS Solutions Group meets monthly.</p>

The [Data Center Services (DCS) Solutions Groups] (http://dir.texas.gov/View-About-DIR/Data-Center/Pages/Content.aspx?id=12) are at the 'front line' to address issues related to specific services provided through the State Data Center. There are five Solutions Groups, including the most recently created GIS Solutions Group, whose main tasks are to tackle issues and concerns that affect particular services provided by the DCS.

The DCS GIS Solutions Group was created to meet the need for a formal team of agencies willing to participate in shared purchases for GIS data and enterprise technology services.  The catalyst for creating the DCS GIS Solutions Group was a mulit-agency joint effort to obtain a state enterprise license to Google’s 6-inch imagery service. In March 2015, a contract between Google and the state of Texas was executed through the DCS to execute a statewide Google Imagery Service Pilot Project.

The first meeting of the DCS GIS Solutions Group was held on March 25, 2015 with current participating member agencies – [Department of Information Resources](http://dir.texas.gov/), [Commission on Emergency Communications](http://www.csec.texas.gov/), [Texas Commission on Environmental Quality](http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/), [Texas Department of Transportation](https://www.txdot.gov/), and [Texas Water Development Board](http://www.twdb.texas.gov/)(via TNRIS). Serving as associate members are [Texas Parks and Wildlife Department](http://tpwd.texas.gov/), [Texas Department of Public Safety](https://www.txdps.state.tx.us/), and [Texas General Land Office](http://www.glo.texas.gov/). 

The DCS GGIS Solutions Group gathers each month and topics of discussion include:

- Google Imagery Pilot
  - Software and application access experience
  - Usage metrics and cost model
  - Imagery updates to the service
  - Prioritization of new imagery purchases
  - Progress updates from Google

- Geospatial Data
  - Authoritative Sources
  - Barriers to sharing
  - Statewide Address/Parcel Data
  - Enterprise data storage and access
