<p class="lead">The Texas Natural Resources Information System, along with the Texas Department of Information Resources, established the DCS GIS Solutions Group to help address the complexities of geographic information systems in the state. The Solutions Group provides a platform for sharing information and making unified decisions that will better serve geographic information departments at state agencies. The DCS GIS Solutions Group meets monthly.</p>

## DCS GIS Solutions Group

The Data Center Services (DCS) Solutions Groups are at the 'front line' to address issues related to specific services provided through the State Data Center. There are five Solutions Groups, including the most recently created GIS Solutions Group, whose main tasks are to tackle issues and concerns that affect particular services provided by the DCS. Agency representatives make up the Solutions Groups based on the services they are receiving. Discussions are carried out in each monthly meeting and solutions to issues are reached by consensus, ensuring that the solution meets the needs of all participating agencies. Should a consensus not be reached within the Solutions Groups, the issue is escalated to the Information Technology Leadership Committee (ITLC). The ITLC reviews the issue and proposed solutions, makes recommendations on the solutions, and takes the issue and best possible resolutions to the Business Executive Leadership Committee (BELC), the top-level DCS group in charge of guiding the DCS and resolving issues that cannot be resolved by a Solutions Group. Included in each of the DCS Solutions Groups are the Service Providers to assist DIR and DIR's customers with problem-solving solutions for state agencies.

The DCS GIS Solutions Group was created to meet the need for a formal team of agencies willing to participate in shared purchases for GIS data and enterprise services.  The catalyst for creating the DCS GIS Solutions Group was a joint effort to obtain a state enterprise license to Google’s 6-inch imagery service. In March 2015, a contract between Google and the state of Texas was executed through the DCS to execute a statewide Google Imagery Service Pilot Project.

The first meeting of the DCS GIS Solutions Group was held on March 25, 2015 with the first participating member agencies – Department of Information Resources, Commission on Emergency Communications, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Texas Department of Transportation, and Texas Water Development Board (TNRIS). Currently serving as associate members are Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Texas Department of Public Safety, Texas General Land Office. The main topics of discussion have centered on developing a cost model for public agency access to the Google Imagery Service. As metrics are gathered on total service usage, maintenance costs, and system scalability.

The DCS GIS Solutions group meets monthly to discuss the Google Imagery Project progress and other topics related to GIS data and technology. Current member agencies are the Commission on State Emergency Communications, Texas Department of Transportation, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and Texas Natural Resources Information System.  Associate members are Texas Department of Public Safety, General Land Office, and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The Solutions Groups are open to all DCS state agency customers as well as state agencies with an interest in receiving DCS services.
