The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently published 275 geospatial datasets from its Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) collection. Once available by DVD only, HIFLD uses advanced technology to give users direct access through visualization tools or via download. HIFLD data contains location information for over a dozen asset categories ranging from water supply to retail shipping facilities across the nation.

Improvement of access to national homeland security geospatial data, once primarily used by federal, state, and local emergency support personnel for disaster response, can now be used by the public to support emergency planning and recovery, economic development, and city planning.
