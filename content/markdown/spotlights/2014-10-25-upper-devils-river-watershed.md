TNRIS staff created this image to illustrate the Upper Devil's River watershed, which spans across more than 3500 square miles and covers parts of Crockett, Shleicher, Sutton and Val Verde County.

## What data is used?
The watershed is represented by the [USGS Water Shed Boundaries Dataset (WBD)](data-catalog/hydrography/watershed-boundaries) Upper Devilâ€™s River Huc 8 sub-basin.
{{macros.catalog_data_card('hydrography/watershed-boundaries')}}

The extensive water network seen is represented in blue by the [National Hydrography Dataset(NHD)](data-catalog/hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-and-texas-nhd-river-streams).
{{macros.catalog_data_card('hydrography/nhd-texas-nhd-river-streams')}}

The [National Elevation Dataset (NED)](data-catalog/elevation-image/tx-ned-2013) was used for elevations and is represented by the color ramp showing low areas in red with higher elevations in green.
