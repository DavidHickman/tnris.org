<p class="lead">This Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was acquired from a 2011 [High Priority Imagery and Datasets](high-priority-imagery-data-sets) project by TNRIS. The model covers the area near Gum Pond of North Toledo Bend Wildlife Management Area along the Texas-Louisiana border.</p>

Elevations are represented by a color
ramp with low lying areas in blue and higher elevations in red.  Various
abandoned channels of the Sabine River can be seen here by the numerous oxbow
lakes.

## Where Did the Data Come From?

The TNRIS 2011 50cm LiDAR data was used to generate this image.
