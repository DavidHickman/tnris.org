This Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was acquired from a 2011 High Priority Imagery and Datasets project by TNRIS. The model covers the area near Gum Pond of North Toledo Bend Wildlife Management Area along the Texas-Louisiana border. Elevations are represented by a color ramp with low lying areas in blue and higher elevations in red.  Various abandoned channels of the Sabine River can be seen here by the numerous oxbow lakes.
