This LiDAR point cloud was acquired from a FEMA 2013 data set. The image centers over the Morris Sheppard Dam in Palo Pinto County at the South Eastern edge of Possum Kingdom Lake.

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possum_Kingdom_Lake):

>The lake is located where the Brazos River cuts through the Palo Pinto Hills.The canyon thus formed provided a favorable site for impoundment of the reservoir and accounts for the unusual depth of the lake and the resulting clarity of the water.

The dam was completed in 1942 as a project of the Brazos River Authority and the Works Progress Administration. It stretches 820 meters in length and rises 58 meters in height.

## What data is used?
This LiDAR data is from the [FEMA 2013 60cm](data-catalog/elevation---lidar/fema-2013-60cm/) dataset.
