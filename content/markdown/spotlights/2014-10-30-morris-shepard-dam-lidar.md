This LiDAR point cloud was acquired from a FEMA 2013 data set. The image centers over the Morris Sheppard Dam in Palo Pinto County at the South Eastern edge of Possum Kingdom Lake. The image looks upon the Eastern side of the dam at the spill way.  

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possum_Kingdom_Lake):

>The lake is located where the Brazos River cuts through the Palo Pinto Hills.[7] The canyon thus formed provided a favorable site for impoundment of the reservoir and accounts for the unusual depth of the lake and the resulting clarity of the water.


The dam was completed in 1942 as a project of the Brazos River Authority and the Works Progress Administration and named after US Senator Morris Sheppard, who had secured much of its funding. It stretches 820 meters in length and rises 58 meters in height.
