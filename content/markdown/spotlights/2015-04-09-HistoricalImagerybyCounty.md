## What are we Looking At?

This figure shows the earliest historical imagery in the TNRIS historical archive for each county in Texas dating back to our earliest collection, the Fairchild 1927 imagery of downtown Dallas.   The collections represented by this figure vary in coverage, source, format and scale.   

All imagery dataset represented by this figure are available from the TNRIS Research and Distribution center by filling out an [Orderform](http://tnris.org/order-data).   

## Where Did the Data Come From?

This data was created by using our Historical Aerial Imagery Index which will be coming to our website later this year.
