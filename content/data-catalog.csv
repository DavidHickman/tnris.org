In addition to professional practices, interns were trained in several industry software applications. This product afforded the interns the opportunity to produce an important dataset that is distributed to the public.

Images were scanned at 800 dpi to create a 1 meter resolution dataset. ERDAS AutoSync was used to reference the historical imagery to the TOP 1995/1996 Orthoimagery dataset. The CIAP imagery is the most accurate historical imagery product that TNRIS has produced. The details on each frame’s accuracy and statistics are included in metadata for each frame.

Mosaics were created in the Mosaic Pro toolset of ERDAS. The mosaics are black and white, 1 meter resolution datasets of each of the collections.

The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data layer for the conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by the Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium. 

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies that produce or use land cover data. The main objective of this project was to generate a generalized and nationally consistent land cover data layer for the entire conterminous United States.

The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. 

The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

Each SPOT payload comprises two identical high resolution optical imaging instruments, which can operate simultaneously or individually in either panchromatic (P mode: a single wide band in the visible part of the spectrum) or multispectral mode (XS mode: the green, red, and infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum). 

The orientation of each instrument's strip-selection mirror can be remotely steered by the ground stations, offering an oblique viewing capability up to angles of +/- 27 degrees from the satellite's vertical axis.

These are streams and waterbodies that have been individually defined by the TCEQ and assigned unique identification numbers. Intended to have relatively homogeneous chemical, physical, and hydrological characteristics, a segment provides a basic unit for assigning site-specific standards and for applying water quality management programs of the agency. Both ""classified"" and ""unclassified"" segments have been included in this layer. Classified segments, also referred to as designated segments, refer to water bodies that are
 protected by site- specific criteria. 

The classified segments are listed and described in Appendix A and C of Chapter 307.10. The site-specific uses and criteria are described in Appendix A. Classified waters include most rivers and their major tributaries, major reservoirs, and estuaries. Unclassified waters are those smaller water bodies that do not have site-specific water quality standards assigned to them, but instead are protected by general standards that apply to all surface waters in the state.
 
 This layer also indentifies which segments and water bodies have been assessed in the DRAFT 2010 Texas Integrated Report for Clean Water Act Sections 305 (b) and 303 (d).

TPWD Omernik Regions Level IV,Ecoregion maps assist managers of aquatic and terrestrial resources to understand the regional patterns of the realistically attainable quality of these resources.,"Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. 

The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. 

A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).",Vector,Shapefile,TPWD,Texas,state,,State,Varies,"Basemap, Research, Analysis",Creation date varies,,None,None,None,,,Natural Regions,,https://tpwd.texas.gov/gis/data/baselayers/omernikregions-zip,,,,,d5084e86-dec9-11e4-afda-0e0c41326911,Texas Parks and Wildlife Department,https://tpwd.texas.gov/,,2015-11-20,NA,,

TPWD Significant Streams Segments,Update from NHD to NHDPlus base maps from Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) ,"Ecologically Unique River and Stream Segments (31 TAC 357.8) updated using flowlines from NHDPlus (August 2008). As a result of the passage of Senate Bill 1 in 1997, water planning in Texas became the domain of regional planning groups rather than the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). 

As a part of the planning process, each regional planning group may include recommendations for the designation of ecologically unique river and stream segments in their adopted regional water plan. Stream segment designation is to be supported by a recommendation package that includes a physical description, maps, photographs, literature citations, and data pertaining to each candidate stream segment. 

**In accordance with the TWDB’s rules, the following criteria are to be used when recommending a river or stream segment as being of unique ecological value:** 
- Biological Function: Segments which display significant overall habitat value including both quantity and quality considering the degree of biodiversity, age, and uniqueness observed and including terrestrial, wetland, aquatic, or estuarine habitats.
- Hydrologic Function: Segments which are fringed by habitats that perform valuable hydrologic functions relating to water quality, flood attenuation, flow stabilization, or groundwater recharge and discharge.
- Riparian Conservation Areas: Segments which are fringed by significant areas in public ownership including state and federal refuges, wildlife management areas, preserves, parks, mitigation areas, or other areas held by governmental organizations for conservation purposes under a governmentally approved conservation plan.
- High Water Quality/Exceptional Aquatic Life/High Aesthetic Value: Segments and spring resources that are significant due to unique or critical habitats and exceptional aquatic life uses dependent on or associated with high water quality.
- Threatened or Endangered Species/Unique Communities: Sites along segments where water development projects would have significant detrimental effects on state or federally listed threatened and endangered species, and sites along segments that are significant due to the presence of unique, exemplary, or unusually extensive natural communities.

The Texas legislature can officially designate stream segments as being of unique ecological value following nomination of stream segment by a regional planning group. By so doing, a state agency or political subdivision may not obtain a fee title or an easement that would destroy the unique ecological value of a designated stream.

Natural and human influenced vegetation communities and land uses in Texas.,"The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, in cooperation with private, state, and federal partners, has produced a new land classification map for Texas, based on the NatureServe Ecological System Classification System as described by Comer (2003). Mapping Sub-systems were identified using ecological systems as a starting point. Data was collected in the field and from aerial photography to implement a supervised classification. 

This land cover data was combined with ecoregions, SSURGO soils, DEM-based variables, and hydrology to help interpret the ecological meaning of final mapping targets. Improved thematic and spatial resolution was achieved using a decision tree classifier with both remotely sensed and abiotic variables, map objects generated at 10 m resolution, and the modeling of mapping targets using ecological site descriptions from SSURGO soils and data from the NatureServe systems classifications. Project and partner ecologists have produced detailed descriptions of all Ecological Systems and Mapping Sub-systems that occur throughout the state. This includes floristic details refined by field data collected by project personnel, along with ecological processes such as fire, grazing, flooding that formed or maintains the systems, and the soils and geology that influence the systems. 

Project ecologists have also developed an Interpretive Guide that includes a general description of each Ecological System and subordinate Mapping Sub-systems, a representative photo of most Mapping Sub-systems, a list of public properties where an example of each system may be viewed, and a map showing the mapped distribution of each sub-system.

In 1997, the legislature established a new water planning process, based on a “bottom-up,” consensus-driven approach. Coordinating this water planning process are 16 planning groups, one for each regional water planning area (see map). The planning groups, each made up of about 20 members, represent a variety of interests, including agriculture, industry, environment, public, municipalities, business, water districts, river authorities, water utilities, counties, groundwater management areas, and power generation. Each planning group approved bylaws to govern its methods of conducting business and designated a political subdivision, such as a river authority, groundwater conservation district, or council of governments, to administer the planning process and manage any contracts related to developing regional water plans. The planning groups conduct all functions during open meetings in an open and participatory manner. They hold special public meetings when they develop their scopes of work and hold hearings before adopting their regional water plans. This public involvement helps direct the planning and determine which water management strategies to recommend. Consensus building within the planning groups is crucial to ensure sufficient support for adopting the plan.

The U.S. National Grid is based on universally-defined coordinate and grid systems and can, therefore, be easily extended for use worldwide as a universal grid reference system. In addition, it has the advantage of being easily plotted on USGS topographic and other properly gridded maps by using a simple ""read right and then up"" convention where the user measures to the East and then North in linear increments.

USGS 2012 El Paso 30cm NC,Natural Color 30 centimeter orthoimages covering the urban area footprint of El Paso Texas.,"This data set consists of 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot), natural color orthoimages covering the urban area footprint of El Paso Texas. 

An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 3-meter diagonal RMSE (2.12m RMSE in X or Y). 

Each orthoimage provides imagery over a 1500-meter by 1500-meter block on the ground. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum.

Watershed Boundaries,"The WBD is a seamless and consistent national Geographic Information System (GIS) database at a scale of 1:24,000, which has been extensively reviewed and matches to a minimum the USGS topographical 7.5 minute quadrangle map series.","The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) in Texas was developed as a collaborative product by TWDB, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and USGS. The WBD is a seamless and consistent national Geographic Information System (GIS) database at a scale of 1:24,000, which has been extensively reviewed and matches to a minimum the USGS topographical 7.5 minute quadrangle map series. The traditional 8-digit hydrologic units (HUCs) have been further divided into smaller units called watersheds (10-digit HUCs) and sub-watersheds (12-digit HUCs). The watershed level is typically 40,000 to 250,000 acres, and the sub-watershed level is typically 10,000 to 40,000 acres with some as small as 3,000 acres. Federal Certification of the WBD for Texas was completed jointly by the NRCS and USGS in January 2009. 

This dataset, which has been developed to national standards (USGS and USDA/NRCS 2009), is intended to be managed in concert with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) as part of the Stewardship Program, supported by the U.S. Geological Survey with partner Federal, State and Local entities. Continuing development of the WBD in Texas will be completion of the 10 and 12-digit delineations of coastal watersheds. Some of the low lying coastal HUCs were not completed due to a lack of ultra high resolution elevation data necessary to determine the watershed boundaries.",Vector,Shapefile,USGS,Texas,state,,State,94 MB,Basemap,2009,"Texas, Statewide, Watershed, Hydrography, Hydrology, HUC, Boundaries, USGS, United States Geological Survey","Vectorized from Raster images, stair step effect",None,None,[EPSG 4269](https://epsg.io/4269),,Hydrography,T,https://tnris-datadownload.s3.amazonaws.com/d/wbd-huc/state/tx/wbd-huc_tx.zip,,,,,d5084e86-dec9-11e4-afda-0e0c41326911,,,,2014-02-01,CC0,,
