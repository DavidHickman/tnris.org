The database holds the Federally recognized name of each feature and defines the location of the feature by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other feature attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature designations, feature class, historical and descriptive information, and for some categories of features the geometric boundaries.

The naming convention is based on the U.S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage. These data have been created as a result of the need for having geospatial data immediately available and easily accessible in order to provide geographic reference for federal, state, and local emergency responders, as well as for homeland security efforts.  Orthoimages also serve a variety of purposes, from interim maps to field references for earth science investigations and analysis.  The digital orthoimage is useful as a layer of a geographic information system.

Vegetation,"This data documents the distribution and quantity of natural and human influenced vegetation communities and land uses in Texas. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, in cooperation with private, state, and federal partners, has produced a new land classification map for Texas, based on the NatureServe Ecological System Classification System as described by Comer (2003). Mapping Sub-systems were identified using ecological systems as a starting point. Data was collected in the field and from aerial photography to implement a supervised classification. This land cover data was combined with ecoregions, SSURGO soils, DEM-based variables, and hydrology to help interpret the ecological meaning of final mapping targets. Improved thematic and spatial resolution was achieved using a decision tree classifier with both remotely sensed and abiotic variables, map objects generated at 10 m resolution, and the modeling of mapping targets using ecological site descriptions from SSURGO soils and data from the NatureServe systems classifications. Project and partner ecologists have produced detailed descriptions of all Ecological Systems and Mapping Sub-systems that occur throughout the state. This includes floristic details refined by field data collected by project personnel, along with ecological processes such as fire, grazing, flooding that formed or maintains the systems, and the soils and geology that influence the systems. Project ecologists have also developed an Interpretive Guide that includes a general description of each Ecological System and subordinate Mapping Sub-systems, a representative photo of most Mapping Sub-systems, a list of public properties where an example of each system may be viewed, and a map showing the mapped distribution of each sub-system. The interpretive guide also includes a detailed project methodology and ecological information on select eco-regions.",Vector,GDB,TPWD,US EPA Ecoregions,Statewide,5.5 GB,Basemap,2011,"Vegetation, Communities, Land Use, Texas, Statewide, TPWD, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department","Vectorized from Raster images, stair step effect",None,None,,Natural Regions,F,,T,,,,,
Watershed Boundaries,"The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) in Texas was developed as a collaborative product by TWDB, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and USGS.  The WBD is a seamless and consistent national Geographic Information System (GIS) database at a scale of 1:24,000, which has been extensively reviewed and matches to a minimum the USGS topographical 7.5 minute quadrangle map series. The traditional 8-digit hydrologic units (HUCs) have been further divided into smaller units called watersheds (10-digit HUCs) and sub-watersheds (12-digit HUCs). The watershed level is typically 40,000 to 250,000 acres, and the sub-watershed level is typically 10,000 to 40,000 acres with some as small as 3,000 acres. Federal Certification of the WBD for Texas was completed jointly by the NRCS and USGS in January 2009.  This dataset, which has been developed to national standards (USGS and USDA/NRCS 2009), is intended to be managed in concert with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) as part of the Stewardship Program, supported by the U.S. Geological Survey with partner Federal, State and Local entities. Continuing development of the WBD in Texas will be completion of the 10 and 12-digit delineations of coastal watersheds.  Some of the low lying coastal HUCs were not completed due to a lack of ultra high resolution elevation data necessary to determine the watershed boundaries.",Vector,Shapefile,USGS,Texas,Statewide,94 MB,Basemap,2009,"Texas, Statewide, Watershed, Hydrography, Hydrology, HUC,  Boundaries, USGS, United States Geological Survey","Vectorized from Raster images, stair step effect",None,None,,Hydrography,T,,F,,,,,
