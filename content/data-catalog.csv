In addition to professional practices, interns were trained in several industry software applications.

The CIAP imagery is the most accurate historical imagery product that TNRIS has produced. The details on each frame’s accuracy and statistics are included in metadata for each frame.

Mosaics were created in the Mosaic Pro toolset of ERDAS. The mosaics are black and white, 1 meter resolution datasets of each of the collections.

The DRG can also be merged with other digital data, e.g. DEM's or DOQ's, to produce a hybrid digital file.

PLSS Section,The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is a way of subdividing and describing land in the United States.,"The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is a way of subdividing and describing land in the United States. All lands in the public domain are subject to subdivision by this rectangular system of surveys, which is regulated by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The PLSS typically divides land into 6-mile-square townships, which is the level of information included in the National Atlas. Townships are subdivided into 36 one-mile- square sections. Sections can be further subdivided into quarter sections, quarter-quarter sections, or irregular government lots. 

Normally, a permanent monument, or marker, is placed at each section corner. Monuments are also placed at quarter-section corners and at other important points, such as the corners of government lots. Today permanent monuments are usually inscribed tablets set on iron rods or in concrete.

A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management.

In 1997, the legislature established a new water planning process, based on a “bottom-up,” consensus-driven approach. Coordinating this water planning process are 16 planning groups, one for each regional water planning area (see map). The planning groups, each made up of about 20 members, represent a variety of interests, including agriculture, industry, environment, public, municipalities, business, water districts, river authorities, water utilities, counties, groundwater management areas, and power generation. Each planning group approved bylaws to govern its methods of conducting business and designated a political subdivision, such as a river authority, groundwater conservation district, or council of governments, to administer the planning process and manage any contracts related to developing regional water plans. The planning groups conduct all functions during open meetings in an open and participatory manner. They hold special public meetings when they develop their scopes of work and hold hearings before adopting their regional water plans.

The U.S. National Grid is based on universally-defined coordinate and grid systems and can, therefore, be easily extended for use worldwide as a universal grid reference system. In addition, it has the advantage of being easily plotted on USGS topographic and other properly gridded maps by using a simple ""read right and then up"" convention where the user measures to the East and then North in linear increments. The coordinates are easily translated to distance as they are actually in meters rather than the more complex degree based increments of latitude and longitude.

Vegetation,Natural and human influenced vegetation communities and land uses in Texas.,"This data documents the distribution and quantity of natural and human influenced vegetation communities and land uses in Texas. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, in cooperation with private, state, and federal partners, has produced a new land classification map for Texas, based on the NatureServe Ecological System Classification System as described by Comer (2003). Mapping Sub-systems were identified using ecological systems as a starting point. 

Data was collected in the field and from aerial photography to implement a supervised classification. This land cover data was combined with ecoregions, SSURGO soils, DEM-based variables, and hydrology to help interpret the ecological meaning of final mapping targets. Improved thematic and spatial resolution was achieved using a decision tree classifier with both remotely sensed and abiotic variables, map objects generated at 10 m resolution, and the modeling of mapping targets using ecological site descriptions from SSURGO soils and data from the NatureServe systems classifications. 

Project and partner ecologists have produced detailed descriptions of all Ecological Systems and Mapping Sub-systems that occur throughout the state. This includes floristic details refined by field data collected by project personnel, along with ecological processes such as fire, grazing, flooding that formed or maintains the systems, and the soils and geology that influence the systems.

 Project ecologists have also developed an Interpretive Guide that includes a general description of each Ecological System and subordinate Mapping Sub-systems, a representative photo of most Mapping Sub-systems, a list of public properties where an example of each system may be viewed, and a map showing the mapped distribution of each sub-system. The interpretive guide also includes a detailed project methodology and ecological information on select eco-regions.",Vector,GDB,TPWD,US EPA Ecoregions,,Statewide,5.5 GB,Basemap,2011,"Vegetation, Communities, Land Use, Texas, Statewide, TPWD, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department","Vectorized from Raster images, stair step effect",None,None,,Natural Regions,T,https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B32g5sG2VKbgbl9oOGlneUdMZjA&usp=sharing,T,,,,d5084e86-dec9-11e4-afda-0e0c41326911,,,
Watershed Boundaries,"The WBD is a seamless and consistent national Geographic Information System (GIS) database at a scale of 1:24,000, which has been extensively reviewed and matches to a minimum the USGS topographical 7.5 minute quadrangle map series.","The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) in Texas was developed as a collaborative product by TWDB, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and USGS.  The WBD is a seamless and consistent national Geographic Information System (GIS) database at a scale of 1:24,000, which has been extensively reviewed and matches to a minimum the USGS topographical 7.5 minute quadrangle map series. The traditional 8-digit hydrologic units (HUCs) have been further divided into smaller units called watersheds (10-digit HUCs) and sub-watersheds (12-digit HUCs). The watershed level is typically 40,000 to 250,000 acres, and the sub-watershed level is typically 10,000 to 40,000 acres with some as small as 3,000 acres. Federal Certification of the WBD for Texas was completed jointly by the NRCS and USGS in January 2009.  

This dataset, which has been developed to national standards (USGS and USDA/NRCS 2009), is intended to be managed in concert with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) as part of the Stewardship Program, supported by the U.S. Geological Survey with partner Federal, State and Local entities. Continuing development of the WBD in Texas will be completion of the 10 and 12-digit delineations of coastal watersheds.  Some of the low lying coastal HUCs were not completed due to a lack of ultra high resolution elevation data necessary to determine the watershed boundaries.",Vector,Shapefile,USGS,Texas,,Statewide,94 MB,Basemap,2009,"Texas, Statewide, Watershed, Hydrography, Hydrology, HUC,  Boundaries, USGS, United States Geological Survey","Vectorized from Raster images, stair step effect",None,None,,Hydrography,T,https://tnris-datadownload.s3.amazonaws.com/d/wbd-huc/state/tx/wbd-huc_tx.zip,,,,,d5084e86-dec9-11e4-afda-0e0c41326911,,,
