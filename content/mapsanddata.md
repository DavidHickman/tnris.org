TNRIS archives, maintains, and distributes the largest collection of current and historical geographic data sets for the State of Texas. Our mission is to **make it easily accessible and available to the public**.

Our collection of maps, photos, documents and other spatial datasets were acquired over time from multiple sources including state, federal, and local agencies with support and donations from private sources.
