TNRIS archives, maintains, and distributes the largest collection of current and historical geographic data sets for the State of Texas. Our mission is to **make it easily accessible and available to the public**.

Our collection of maps, photos, documents and other spatial datasets were acquired from multiple sources including state, federal, and local agencies with support and donations from private sources. They encompass a wide range of years, beginning all the way from the 1920s to the present-day.
