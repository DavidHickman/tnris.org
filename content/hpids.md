abstract: 
---

The Council on Competitive Government (CCG) established a procurement contract designed to strengthen Texas’ capabilities to purchase quality digital map data for both government and the public. The new process employs a state Master Contract commonly known as ** High Priority Imagery and Datasets (HPIDS)**. High Priority Datasets are digital map data layers designed to be used by government agencies and the public.

The CCG has designated the Texas Water Development Board as the Contract Administrator. Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) is the state’s clearinghouse for digital maps and geographic data and is is responsible for the success of HPIDS.

##Strategic Collaboration and Integration

Combined professional expertise to enhance project specifications resulting in better data products. Working together generates new ideas for creating smarter geospatial data that can be used by many organizations. If desired, we will help you select the company that will best suit your needs.

##Taxpayer Value

By combining our geospatial projects, we can acquire a larger area at a discounted unit price and reduce duplication.

##Efficient Purchasing Process

Since the contract with the vendors is already in place, a contract between you and the vendor not required. A statement of work and a purchase order will suffice.

##Project Assistance and Coordination

There are several options ranging from self service to full service. We can help you seek additional project partners to expand the area of interest or to share the project cost.

##Continuous Improvement

Each project performed under the HPIDS Contract takes away valuable experiences that help improve data standards and overall project management.

##Increased Opportunity for Cost Sharing

By notifying us about a potential project, you may be alerted to another entity interested in purchasing a similar product or area of interest.

##Pre-screened Companies with Geospatial Experience

Each of the 21 companies selected were carefully evaluated for project experience and success. Qualifications include large scale project experience, technology innovation, professional staff, and available resources.
