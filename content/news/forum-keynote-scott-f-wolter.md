TNRIS is pleased to announce Forensic geologist Scott Wolter as a keynote
speaker at the 2014 GIS Forum! Wolter is the host of History’s H2 network’s hit
show, America Unearthed, that follows him on his quest to uncover the truth
behind historic artifacts and sites found throughout North America.

Scott is the author of several books including his 2013 title, Akhenaten to the
Founding Fathers: The Mysteries of the Hooked X and The Hooked X: Key to the
Secret History of North America. Together these books cover the story of his
continuing research and resulting discoveries made over the last 12 years,
beginning with his ongoing quest to uncover the mysteries of the controversial
Kensington Rune Stone he studied in 2001. The Kensington stone is a medieval
document carved in rock which Scott proposed is a land claim placed in Minnesota
in 1362 by a group of Templar knights.

Professionally, Scott, a forensic geologist, has been President of American
Petrographic Services since 1990. He has been the principal petrographer in more
than 5,000 material forensic investigations throughout the world, including the
evaluation of fire-damaged concrete from the Pentagon following the attacks of
September 11, 2001.

Books and other TV projects: Akhenaten to the Founding Fathers: The Mysteries of
the Hooked X

The Hooked X: Key to the Secret History of North America

The Kensington Rune Stone: Compelling New Evidence

Holy Grail In America, a two-hour documentary that premiered on History in

Unearthed.
