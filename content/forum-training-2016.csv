INTRODUCTION arcgisearth If you’ve ever used Google Earth you’ve no doubt loved how easy it is to use for exploring the globe and creating great visualizations. The new ArcGIS Earth product from Esri has many of the same Google Earth like functions plus a lot of the features you’ve used with ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Desktop. ArcGIS Earth lets you explore the world in 3D and 2D formats and load your own data from various sources including KML, shapefiles, CSV files, ArcGIS Server, and ArcGIS Online. These data sources can be draped across the terrain for realistic 3D visualizations. You can also add various pre-created basemaps from ArcGIS Online. 

In addition to displaying data in these formats you can also create sketches including points, lines, and polygons and add labels to these features. You can also measure features in 3D, search for addresses and known locations, print maps, and email views. Touch navigation is also possible if you have a touch screen Windows device. Rather than using mouse for navigation you can just use your fingers to zoom in and out, pan, rotate the view, and adjust the camera angle. And this is all in version 1.0 of ArcGIS Earth. In future releases you can expect to see additional functionality including map tours, offline use, timesliders, support for WMS, and much more! In this half day class you’ll learn how to put ArcGIS Earth as a new tool in your GIS toolbox.
