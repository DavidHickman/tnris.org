<p class="lead">The Texas Google Imagery Service is designed to provide high resolution imagery showing the entire state of Texas with its most current coverage. The service provides continuous 6-inch natural color imagery for the entire state.</p>

<p class="lead">Making Google imagery available to all public agencies in Texas distributes the cost, making the imagery and the updates affordable to all.</p>

  <strong>As a state provisioned service, Google Imagery has two primary benefits:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Giving organizations current imagery for mapping. </li>
  <li>Creating a consistent data source so any mapping performed will reflect the same underlying data as any other organization who uses it. This will keep maps for decision makers up to date and ahead of the consumer free imagery that is used by the public.</li>
